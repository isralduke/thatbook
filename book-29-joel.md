## Chapter 1

> <a>1:1</a> This is the LORD’s message that was given
> to Joel the son of Pethuel:

### A Locust Plague Foreshadows the Day of the Lord

> <a>1:2</a> Listen to this, you elders,
> and pay attention, all inhabitants of the land.
> Has anything like this ever happened in your whole life
> or in the lifetime of your ancestors?
> <a>1:3</a> Tell your children about it,
> and have your children tell their children,
> and their children the following generation.
> <a>1:4</a> What the gazam-locust left the ‘arbeh-locust consumed,
> and what the ‘arbeh-locust left the yeleq-locust consumed,
> and what the yeleq-locust left the hasil-locust consumed!
> <a>1:5</a> Awake, you drunkards, and weep!
> Wail, all you wine drinkers, over the sweet wine
> because it has been taken away from you.
> <a>1:6</a> For a “nation” has invaded our land.
> There are so many of them they are too numerous to count.
> Their teeth are like those of a lion;
> their incisors are like those of a lioness.
> <a>1:7</a> They have desolated our vines;
> they have left our fig trees in splinters.
> They have completely stripped off the bark and thrown them aside;
> the twigs are stripped bare.

### A Call to Lament

> <a>1:8</a> Wail like a young virgin clothed in sackcloth,
> lamenting the death of her husband-to-be.
> <a>1:9</a> No one brings grain offerings or drink offerings
> to the temple of the LORD anymore.
> So the priests, those who serve the LORD, are in mourning.
> <a>1:10</a> The crops of the fields have been destroyed.
> The ground is in mourning because the grain has perished.
> The fresh wine has dried up;
> the olive oil languishes.
> <a>1:11</a> Be distressed, farmers;
> wail, wine dressers, over the wheat and the barley.
> For the harvest of the field has perished.
> <a>1:12</a> The vine has dried up;
> the fig tree languishes,
> the pomegranate and date and apple as well.
> In fact, all the trees of the field have dried up.
> Indeed, the joy of the people has dried up!
> <a>1:13</a> Get dressed and lament, you priests!
> Wail, you who minister at the altar!
> Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you servants of my God,
> because no one brings grain offerings or drink offerings
> to the temple of your God anymore.
> <a>1:14</a> Announce a holy fast;
> proclaim a sacred assembly.
> Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land
> to the temple of the LORD your God,
> and cry out to the LORD.
> <a>1:15</a> How awful that day will be!
> For the day of the LORD is near;
> it will come as destruction from the Divine Destroyer.
> <a>1:16</a> Our food has been cut off right before our eyes!
> There is no longer any joy or gladness in the temple of our God!
> <a>1:17</a> The grains of seed have shriveled beneath their shovels.
> Storehouses have been decimated
> and granaries have been torn down, for the grain has dried up.
> <a>1:18</a> Listen to the cattle groan!
> The herds of livestock wander around in confusion
> because they have no pasture.
> Even the flocks of sheep are suffering.
> <a>1:19</a> To you, O LORD, I call out for help;
> for fire has burned up the grassy pastures,
> and flames have razed all the trees in the fields.
> <a>1:20</a> Even the wild animals cry out to you;
> for the river beds have dried up,
> and fire has destroyed the grassy pastures.

## Chapter 2

### The Locusts’ Devastation

> <a>2:1</a> Blow the trumpet in Zion;
> sound the alarm signal on my holy mountain!
> Let all the inhabitants of the land shake with fear,
> for the day of the LORD is about to come.
> Indeed, it is near!
> <a>2:2</a> It will be a day of dreadful darkness,
> a day of foreboding storm-clouds,
> like blackness spread over the mountains.
> It is a huge and powerful army—
> there has never been anything like it ever before,
> and there will not be anything like it for many generations to come!
> <a>2:3</a> Like fire they devour everything in their path;
> a flame blazes behind them.
> The land looks like the Garden of Eden before them,
> but behind them there is only a desolate wilderness—
> for nothing escapes them!
> <a>2:4</a> They look like horses;
> they charge ahead like war horses.
> <a>2:5</a> They sound like chariots rumbling over mountain tops,
> like the crackling of blazing fire consuming stubble,
> like the noise of a mighty army being drawn up for battle.
> <a>2:6</a> People writhe in fear when they see them.
> All of their faces turn pale with fright.
> <a>2:7</a> They charge like warriors;
> they scale walls like soldiers.
> Each one proceeds on his course;
> they do not alter their path.
> <a>2:8</a> They do not jostle one another;
> each of them marches straight ahead.
> They burst through the city defenses
> and do not break ranks.
> <a>2:9</a> They rush into the city;
> they scale its walls.
> They climb up into the houses;
> they go in through the windows like a thief.
> <a>2:10</a> The earth quakes before them;
> the sky reverberates.
> The sun and the moon grow dark;
> the stars refuse to shine.
> <a>2:11</a> The voice of the LORD thunders as he leads his army.
> Indeed, his battle forces are very large;
> Surely his command is carried out!
> Yes, the day of the LORD is great
> and very terrifying—who can survive it?

### An Appeal for Repentance

> <a>2:12</a> “Yet even now,” the LORD says,
> “return to me with all your heart—
> with fasting, weeping, and mourning.
> Tear your hearts,
> not just your garments!”
> <a>2:13</a> Return to the LORD your God,
> for he is merciful and compassionate,
> slow to anger and boundless in loyal love—
> often relenting from calamitous punishment.
> <a>2:14</a> Who knows?
> Perhaps he will be compassionate and grant a reprieve,
> and leave blessing in his wake—
> a meal offering and a drink offering for you to offer to the LORD your God!
> <a>2:15</a> Blow the trumpet in Zion.
> Announce a holy fast;
> proclaim a sacred assembly.
> <a>2:16</a> Gather the people;
> sanctify an assembly.
> Gather the elders;
> gather the children and the nursing infants.
> Let the bridegroom come out from his bedroom
> and the bride from her private quarters.
> <a>2:17</a> Let the priests, those who serve the LORD, weep
> from the vestibule all the way back to the altar.
> Let them say, “Have pity, O LORD, on your people;
> please do not turn over your inheritance to be mocked,
> to become a proverb among the nations.
> Why should it be said among the peoples,
> “Where is their God?”

### The LORD’s Response

> <a>2:18</a> Then the LORD became zealous for his land;
> he had compassion on his people.
> <a>2:19</a> The LORD responded to his people,
> “Look! I am about to send grain to you,
> as well as fresh wine and olive oil.
> You will be fully satisfied.
> I will never again make you an object of mockery among the nations.
> <a>2:20</a> I will remove the one from the north far from you.
> I will drive him out to a dry and desolate place.
> Those in front will be driven eastward into the Dead Sea,
> and those in back westward into the Mediterranean Sea.
> His stench will rise up as a foul smell.”
> Indeed, the LORD has accomplished great things.
> <a>2:21</a> Do not fear, my land!
> Rejoice and be glad,
> because the LORD has accomplished great things!
> <a>2:22</a> Do not fear, wild animals!
> For the pastures of the wilderness are again green with grass.
> Indeed, the trees bear their fruit;
> the fig tree and the vine yield to their fullest.
> <a>2:23</a> Citizens of Zion, rejoice!
> Be glad because of what the LORD your God has done!
> For he has given to you the early rains as vindication.
> He has sent to you the rains—
> both the early and the late rains as formerly.
> <a>2:24</a> The threshing floors are full of grain;
> the vats overflow with fresh wine and olive oil.
> <a>2:25</a> I will make up for the years
> that the ‘arbeh-locust consumed your crops—
> the yeleq-locust, the hasil-locust, and the gazam-locust—
> my great army, that I sent against you.
> <a>2:26</a> You will have plenty to eat,
> and your hunger will be fully satisfied;
> you will praise the name of the LORD your God,
> who has acted wondrously in your behalf.
> My people will never again be put to shame.
> <a>2:27</a> You will be convinced that I am in the midst of Israel.
> I am the LORD your God; there is no other.
> My people will never again be put to shame.

### An Outpouring of the Spirit

> <a>2:28</a> After all of this
> I will pour out my Spirit on all kinds of people.
> Your sons and daughters will prophesy.
> Your elderly will have revelatory dreams;
> your young men will see prophetic visions.
> <a>2:29</a> Even on male and female servants
> I will pour out my Spirit in those days.
> <a>2:30</a> I will produce portents both in the sky and on the earth—
> blood, fire, and columns of smoke.
> <a>2:31</a> The sunlight will be turned to darkness
> and the moon to the color of blood,
> before the day of the LORD comes—
> that great and terrible day!
> <a>2:32</a> It will so happen that
> everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be delivered.
> For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who survive,
> just as the LORD has promised;
> the remnant will be those whom the LORD will call.

## Chapter 3

### The LORD Plans to Judge the Nations

> <a>3:1</a> For look! In those days and at that time
> I will return the exiles to Judah and Jerusalem.
> <a>3:2</a> Then I will gather all the nations,
> and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat.
> I will enter into judgment against them there
> concerning my people Israel who are my inheritance,
> whom they scattered among the nations.
> They partitioned my land,
> <a>3:3</a> and they cast lots for my people.
> They traded a boy for a prostitute;
> they sold a little girl for wine so they could drink.
> <a>3:4</a> Why are you doing these things to me, Tyre and Sidon?
> Are you trying to get even with me, land of Philistia?
> I will very quickly repay you for what you have done.
> <a>3:5</a> For you took my silver and my gold
> and brought my precious valuables to your own palaces.
> <a>3:6</a> You sold Judeans and Jerusalemites to the Greeks,
> removing them far from their own country.
> <a>3:7</a> Look! I am rousing them from that place to which you sold them.
> I will repay you for what you have done.
> <a>3:8</a> I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah.
> They will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.
> Indeed, the LORD has spoken!
> Judgment in the Valley of Jehoshaphat
> <a>3:9</a> Proclaim this among the nations:
> “Prepare for a holy war!
> Call out the warriors!
> Let all these fighting men approach and attack!
> <a>3:10</a> Beat your plowshares into swords,
> and your pruning hooks into spears.
> Let the weak say, ‘I too am a warrior!’
> <a>3:11</a> Lend your aid and come,
> all you surrounding nations,
> and gather yourselves to that place.”
> Bring down, O LORD, your warriors!
> <a>3:12</a> Let the nations be roused and let them go up
> to the valley of Jehoshaphat,
> for there I will sit in judgment on all the surrounding nations.
> <a>3:13</a> Rush forth with the sickle, for the harvest is ripe!
> Come, stomp the grapes, for the winepress is full!
> The vats overflow.
> Indeed, their evil is great!
> <a>3:14</a> Crowds, great crowds are in the valley of decision,
> for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision!
> <a>3:15</a> The sun and moon are darkened;
> the stars withhold their brightness.
> <a>3:16</a> The LORD roars from Zion;
> from Jerusalem he sounds forth his voice.
> The heavens and the earth shake.
> But the LORD is a refuge for his people;
> he is a stronghold for the citizens of Israel.

### The LORD’s Presence in Zion

> <a>3:17</a> You will be convinced that I the LORD am your God,
> dwelling on Zion, my holy mountain.
> Jerusalem will be holy—
> conquering armies will no longer pass through it.
> <a>3:18</a> On that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine,
> and the hills will flow with milk.
> All the dry stream beds of Judah will flow with water.
> A spring will flow out from the temple of the LORD,
> watering the valley of acacia trees.
> <a>3:19</a> Egypt will be desolate
> and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,
> because of the violence they did to the people of Judah,
> in whose land they shed innocent blood.
> <a>3:20</a> But Judah will reside securely forever,
> and Jerusalem will be secure from one generation to the next.
> <a>3:21</a> And I will avenge their blood which I had not previously acquitted.

It is the LORD who dwells in Zion!
