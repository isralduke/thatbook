### ח (Khet)

### מ (Mem)

### ס (Samek)

> <a name="1:15">1:15</a> The Lord has hurled all my valiant warriors

> the virgin daughter of Judah.

### ע (Ayin)

> <a name="1:16">1:16</a> I weep on account of these things;

### נ (Nun)

> <a name="2:14">2:14</a> The visions that your prophets proclaimed to you

### Jerusalem Speaks:

### ר (Resh)

### ב (Bet)

> <a name="3:6">3:6</a> He has made me reside in intense darkness

### ג (Gimel)

> <a name="3:7">3:7</a> He has walled me in so that I cannot escape;

> <a name="3:8">3:8</a> Even though I cry out desperately for help,
> he shuts his ears to my prayer.
> <a name="3:9">3:9</a> He has blocked every road I take with a wall of fitted stones;
> he has made every path on which I flee impossible to traverse.

### ד (Dalet)

> <a name="3:10">3:10</a> He is like a bear lying in wait for me,
> like a hidden lion stalking its prey.
> <a name="3:11">3:11</a> He dragged me from the path and tore me to pieces,
> and mangled me beyond rescue.
> <a name="3:12">3:12</a> He drew his bow
> and made me the target for his arrows.

### ה (He)

> <a name="3:13">3:13</a> He shot his arrows
> into my heart.
> <a name="3:14">3:14</a> I have become the laughingstock of all people;
> I am the subject of their mockery continually.
> <a name="3:15">3:15</a> He has made me eat bitter herbs,
> and made me drink stagnant water.

### ו (Vav)

> <a name="3:16">3:16</a> He has broken my teeth with gravel;
> he has made me cower in ashes.
> <a name="3:17">3:17</a> I am deprived of peace;
> I have forgotten what happiness is.
> <a name="3:18">3:18</a> So I said, “My endurance has perished,
> I have lost all hope of deliverance from the Lord.”

### ז (Zayin)

> <a name="3:19">3:19</a> Just thinking about my impoverished and homeless condition
> is bitter poison.
> <a name="3:20">3:20</a> When I continually think about this,
> I become emotionally depressed.
> <a name="3:21">3:21</a> But this I call to mind,
> therefore I have hope:

### ח (Khet)

> <a name="3:22">3:22</a> The Lord’s many kindnesses never cease,
> for his great compassion never comes to an end.
> <a name="3:23">3:23</a> They are renewed every morning;

### ט (Tet)

> <a name="3:25">3:25</a> The Lord is good to those who trust in him,

> <a name="3:27">3:27</a> It is good for a man to bear the yoke
> while he is young.

### י (Yod)

> <a name="3:28">3:28</a> Let a person sit alone in silence,
> when the Lord is disciplining him.
> <a name="3:29">3:29</a> Let him bury his face in the dust;
> there may yet be hope.
> <a name="3:30">3:30</a> Let him offer his cheek to the one who hits him;
> let him have his fill of insults.

### כ (Kaf)

> <a name="3:31">3:31</a> For the Lord will not
> reject us forever.
> <a name="3:32">3:32</a> Though he has caused us grief, he will have compassion on us,
> according to the abundance of his kindness.
> <a name="3:33">3:33</a> For he does not enjoy bringing affliction
> nor causing grief to mortal men.

### ל (Lamed)

> <a name="3:34">3:34</a> To crush underfoot
> all the prisoners in the land,
> <a name="3:35">3:35</a> to deprive a man of his rights
> in the presence of the Most High,
> <a name="3:36">3:36</a> to subvert a man in his just cause—
> the Lord does not approve of such things!

### מ (Mem)

> <a name="3:37">3:37</a> Whose command was ever fulfilled
> unless the Lord had decreed it?
> <a name="3:38">3:38</a> Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that everything comes—
> both calamity and blessings?
> <a name="3:39">3:39</a> Why should any living man complain
> when he is punished for his sins?

### נ (Nun)

> <a name="3:40">3:40</a> Let us carefully examine our ways,
> and let us return to the Lord.
> <a name="3:41">3:41</a> Let us lift up our hearts and our hands
> to God in heaven:
> <a name="3:42">3:42</a> “We have sinned rebelliously;
> you have not forgiven.”

### ס (Samek)

> <a name="3:43">3:43</a> You have clothed yourself with anger and pursued us;
> you have slaughtered us without pity.
> <a name="3:44">3:44</a> You have hidden yourself in a cloud
> so that no prayer can pass through.
> <a name="3:45">3:45</a> You have made us like filthy excrement

> because my people are destroyed.

### ע (Ayin)

> <a name="3:49">3:49</a> Tears flow from my eyes unceasingly;
> they will not stop
> <a name="3:50">3:50</a> until the Lord looks down
> from heaven and sees what has happened.
> <a name="3:51">3:51</a> What my eyes see causes grief to me

### ק (Qof)

> <a name="3:55">3:55</a> I called on your name, O Lord,
> from the depths of the pit.
> <a name="3:56">3:56</a> You heard my plea:
> “Do not close your ears to my cry for help!”
> <a name="3:57">3:57</a> You came near when I called to you;
> you said, “Do not fear!”

### ר (Resh)

> <a name="3:58">3:58</a> You championed my cause, O Lord;

> <a name="3:59">3:59</a> You have seen the wrong done to me, O Lord;

### ת (Tav)

> <a name="3:64">3:64</a> Pay them back what they deserve, O Lord,

### ט (Tet)

### ש (Sin/Shin)

> <a name="4:21">4:21</a> Rejoice and be glad for now, O people of Edom,

### The People of Jerusalem Pray:

> <a name="5:1">5:1</a> O Lord, consider what has happened to us;
> please pay attention and take notice of the disgrace we are suffering.
> <a name="5:2">5:2</a> Strangers have taken possession of the land that we inherited,
> foreigners now occupy our homes.
> <a name="5:3">5:3</a> We have become orphans and fatherless,
> our mothers have become widows.
> <a name="5:4">5:4</a> We must pay money to drink our own water;
> we must buy our own wood at a steep price.
> <a name="5:5">5:5</a> We are pursued—our adversaries are breathing down our necks;
> we are physically worn out and cannot find any rest.
> <a name="5:6">5:6</a> We have made treaties with Egypt and Assyria
> just to acquire enough food to keep us alive.
> <a name="5:7">5:7</a> Our ancestors sinned and are now dead,
> so we are left to bear their punishment.
> <a name="5:8">5:8</a> Tyrants rule over us;
> there is no one to rescue us from their control.
> <a name="5:9">5:9</a> We risk our lives when we search for food
> because murderous marauders lurk in the countryside.
> <a name="5:10">5:10</a> Our skin is hot as an oven;
> we are feverish from hunger.
> <a name="5:11">5:11</a> Our wives have been raped in the City of Zion;
> our virgin daughters have been ravished in the towns of Judah.
> <a name="5:12">5:12</a> They executed the royal family by hanging;
> they have mistreated our elders.
> <a name="5:13">5:13</a> They force our young men to perform menial physical labor;
> they make our boys carry heavy loads of wood.
> <a name="5:14">5:14</a> The elders no longer conduct business at the city gate;
> the young men have stopped playing their joyful music.
> <a name="5:15">5:15</a> Our hearts no longer experience any joy;
> instead of dancing with joy, we mourn and lament.
> <a name="5:16">5:16</a> The crown has fallen from our head;
> woe to us, for we have sinned!
> <a name="5:17">5:17</a> Because of this, we are very sorrowful;
> because of these things, we can hardly see through our tears.
> <a name="5:18">5:18</a> For wild animals are prowling over Mount Zion,
> which lies deserted.
> <a name="5:19">5:19</a> But you, O Lord, reign forever;
> your throne endures from generation to generation.
> <a name="5:20">5:20</a> Why have you forgotten us forever?
> Why do you forsake us so long?
> <a name="5:21">5:21</a> Bring us back to yourself, O Lord, and let us return to you;
> renew our life as in ancient times.
> <a name="5:22">5:22</a> Or are you determined to reject us once and for all?
> Are you angry with us beyond limit?
