# Exodus

## Chapter 1

<a name="1:1">1:1</a> These are the names of the sons of Israel who entered Egypt  —  each man with his household entered with Jacob: <a name="1:2">1:2</a> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, <a name="1:3">1:3</a> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, <a name="1:4">1:4</a> Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. <a name="1:5">1:5</a> All the people who were directly descended from Jacob numbered seventy (Joseph was already in Egypt). <a name="1:6">1:6</a> In time Joseph and his brothers and all that generation died. <a name="1:7">1:7</a> But the Israelites were fruitful, increased abundantly, multiplied, and became exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them.

<a name="1:8">1:8</a> Then a new king, who did not know Joseph, came to power over Egypt. <a name="1:9">1:9</a> He said to his people, “Look at the Israelite people, more numerous and stronger than we are! <a name="1:10">1:10</a> Come, let’s deal wisely with them. Otherwise they will continue to multiply, and if a war breaks out, they will ally themselves with our enemies and fight against us and leave the land.”

<a name="1:11">1:11</a> So they put foremen over them to oppress them with hard labor. As a result they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. <a name="1:12">1:12</a> But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread. As a result the Egyptians loathed the Israelites, <a name="1:13">1:13</a> and they made the Israelites serve rigorously. <a name="1:14">1:14</a> So they made their lives bitter by hard service with mortar and bricks and by all kinds of service in the fields. Every kind of service the Israelites were required to give was rigorous.

<a name="1:15">1:15</a> The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah, and the other Puah, <a name="1:16">1:16</a> “When you assist the Hebrew women in childbirth, observe at the delivery: if it is a son, kill him, but if it is a daughter, she may live.” <a name="1:17">1:17</a> But the midwives feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them; they let the boys live.

<a name="1:18">1:18</a> Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this and let the boys live?” <a name="1:19">1:19</a> The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women — for the Hebrew women are vigorous; they give birth before the midwife comes to them!” <a name="1:20">1:20</a> So God treated the midwives well, and the people multiplied and became very strong. <a name="1:21">1:21</a> And because the midwives feared God, he made households for them.

<a name="1:22">1:22</a> Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, “All sons that are born you must throw into the river, but all daughters you may let live.”

## Chapter 2

### The Birth of the Deliverer

<a name="2:1">2:1</a> A man from the household of Levi married a woman who was a descendant of Levi. <a name="2:2">2:2</a> The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a healthy child, she hid him for three months. <a name="2:3">2:3</a> But when she was no longer able to hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him and sealed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and set it among the reeds along the edge of the Nile. <a name="2:4">2:4</a> His sister stationed herself at a distance to find out what would happen to him.

<a name="2:5">2:5</a> Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself by the Nile, while her attendants were walking alongside the river, and she saw the basket among the reeds. She sent one of her attendants, took it, <a name="2:6">2:6</a> opened it, and saw the child — a boy, crying! — and she felt compassion for him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”

<a name="2:7">2:7</a> Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get a nursing woman for you from the Hebrews, so that she may nurse the child for you?” <a name="2:8">2:8</a> Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Yes, do so.” So the young girl went and got the child’s mother. <a name="2:9">2:9</a> Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him.

<a name="2:10">2:10</a> When the child grew older she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She called his name Moses, saying, “Because I drew him from the water.”

### The Presumption of the Deliverer

<a name="2:11">2:11</a> In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and observed their hard labor, and he saw an Egyptian man attacking a Hebrew man, one of his people. <a name="2:12">2:12</a> He looked this way and that and saw that no one was there, and then he killed the Egyptian and concealed the body in the sand. <a name="2:13">2:13</a> When he went out the next day, there were two Hebrew men fighting. So he said to the one who was in the wrong, “Why are you attacking your fellow Hebrew?”

<a name="2:14">2:14</a> The man replied, “Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Are you planning to kill me like you killed that Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid, thinking, “Surely what I did has become known.” <a name="2:15">2:15</a> When Pharaoh heard about this event, he sought to kill Moses. So Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, and he settled by a certain well.

<a name="2:16">2:16</a> Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and began to draw water and fill the troughs in order to water their father’s flock. <a name="2:17">2:17</a> When some shepherds came and drove them away, Moses came up and defended them and then watered their flock. <a name="2:18">2:18</a> So when they came home to Reuel their father, he asked, “Why have you come home so early today?” <a name="2:19">2:19</a> They said, “An Egyptian man rescued us from the hand of the shepherds, and he actually drew water for us and watered the flock!” <a name="2:20">2:20</a> He said to his daughters, “So where is he? Why in the world did you leave the man? Call him, so that he may eat a meal.”

<a name="2:21">2:21</a> Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave Zipporah, his daughter, to Moses. <a name="2:22">2:22</a> When she bore a son, Moses called his name Gershom, for he said, “I have become a resident alien in a foreign land.”

### The Call of the Deliverer

<a name="2:23">2:23</a> It happened during that long period of time that the king of Egypt died and the Israelites groaned because of the slave labor. They cried out, and their desperate cry because of their slave labor went up to God. <a name="2:24">2:24</a> And God heard their groaning, and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. <a name="2:25">2:25</a> God saw the Israelites, and God understood…

## Chapter 3

<a name="3:1">3:1</a> Now Moses was shepherding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb. <a name="3:2">3:2</a> The Angel of The Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from within a bush. He looked  —  and the bush was ablaze with fire, but it was not being consumed! <a name="3:3">3:3</a> So Moses thought, “I will turn aside to see this amazing sight. Why does the bush not burn up?” <a name="3:4">3:4</a> When The Lord saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him from within the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” And Moses said, “Here I am.” <a name="3:5">3:5</a> God said, “Do not come near here. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” <a name="3:6">3:6</a> He also said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.

<a name="3:7">3:7</a> The Lord said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt. I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. <a name="3:8">3:8</a> I have come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up from that land to a land that is both good and large, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the region of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. <a name="3:9">3:9</a> And now, indeed, the cry of the Israelites has come to me, and I have also seen how severely the Egyptians oppress them. <a name="3:10">3:10</a> So now, go, and I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.”

<a name="3:11">3:11</a> Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, or that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” <a name="3:12">3:12</a> He replied, “Surely I will be with you, and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: When you bring the people out of Egypt, you and they will serve God on this mountain.”

<a name="3:13">3:13</a> Moses said to God, “If I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What is his name?’ — what should I say to them?”

<a name="3:14">3:14</a> God said to Moses, “I AM that I AM.” And he said, “You must say this to the Israelites, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’” <a name="3:15">3:15</a> God also said to Moses, “You must say this to the Israelites, ‘The Lord  —  the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob  —  has sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial from generation to generation.’

<a name="3:16">3:16</a> “Go and bring together the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers, appeared to me  —  the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob — saying, “I have attended carefully to you and to what has been done to you in Egypt, <a name="3:17">3:17</a> and I have promised that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’

<a name="3:18">3:18</a> “The elders will listen to you, and then you and the elders of Israel must go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. So now, let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, so that we may sacrifice to The Lord our God.’ <a name="3:19">3:19</a> But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, not even under force. <a name="3:20">3:20</a> So I will extend my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders that I will do among them, and after that he will release you.

<a name="3:21">3:21</a> “I will give this people favor with the Egyptians, so that when you depart you will not go out empty-handed. <a name="3:22">3:22</a> Every woman will ask her neighbor and the one who happens to be staying in her house for silver items, gold items, and clothing. You will put these articles on your sons and on your daughters  —  thus you will plunder Egypt!”

## Chapter 4

### The Source of Sufficiency

<a name="4:1">4:1</a> Moses answered again, “And if they do not believe me or pay attention to me, but say, ‘The Lord has not appeared to you’?” <a name="4:2">4:2</a> The Lord said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A rod.” <a name="4:3">4:3</a> The Lord said, “Throw it to the ground.” So he threw it to the ground, and it became a snake, and Moses fled from it. <a name="4:4">4:4</a> But The Lord said to Moses, “Put out your hand and grab it by the tail”  —  so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand  —  <a name="4:5">4:5</a> “that they may believe that The Lord, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”

<a name="4:6">4:6</a> The Lord also said to him, “Put your hand into your robe.” So he put his hand into his robe, and when he brought it out  —  there his hand was, leprous like snow! <a name="4:7">4:7</a> He said, “Put your hand back into your robe.” So he put his hand back into his robe, and when he brought it out from his robe  —  there it was, restored like the rest of his skin! <a name="4:8">4:8</a> “If they do not believe you or pay attention to the former sign, then they may believe the latter sign. <a name="4:9">4:9</a> And if they do not believe even these two signs or listen to you, then take some water from the Nile and pour it out on the dry ground. The water that you take out of the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.”

<a name="4:10">4:10</a> Then Moses said to The Lord, “O my Lord, I am not an eloquent man, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant, for I am slow of mouth and slow of tongue.”

<a name="4:11">4:11</a> The Lord said to him, “Who gave a mouth to man, or who makes a person mute or deaf or seeing or blind? Is it not I, The Lord? <a name="4:12">4:12</a> So now, go, and I will be with your mouth and will teach you what you must say.”

<a name="4:13">4:13</a> But Moses said, “O my Lord, please send anyone else whom you wish to send!”

<a name="4:14">4:14</a> Then The Lord became angry with Moses, and he said, “What about your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he can speak very well. Moreover, he is coming to meet you, and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart.

<a name="4:15">4:15</a> “So you are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth. And as for me, I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you both what you must do. <a name="4:16">4:16</a> He will speak for you to the people, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were his God. <a name="4:17">4:17</a> You will also take in your hand this rod, with which you will do the signs.”

### The Return of Moses

<a name="4:18">4:18</a> So Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Let me go, so that I may return to my relatives in Egypt and see if they are still alive.” Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” <a name="4:19">4:19</a> The Lord said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, because all the men who were seeking your life are dead.” <a name="4:20">4:20</a> Then Moses took his wife and his sons and put them on a donkey and headed back to the land of Egypt, and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. <a name="4:21">4:21</a> The Lord said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders I have put under your control. But I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go. <a name="4:22">4:22</a> You must say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says The Lord, “Israel is my son, my firstborn, <a name="4:23">4:23</a> and I said to you, ‘Let my son go that he may serve me,’ but since you have refused to let him go, I will surely kill your son, your firstborn!”’”

<a name="4:24">4:24</a> Now on the way, at a place where they stopped for the night, The Lord met Moses and sought to kill him. <a name="4:25">4:25</a> But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off the foreskin of her son and touched it to Moses’ feet, and said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.” <a name="4:26">4:26</a> So The Lord let him alone. (At that time she said, “A bridegroom of blood,” referring to the circumcision.)

<a name="4:27">4:27</a> The Lord said to Aaron, “Go to the wilderness to meet Moses. So he went and met him at the mountain of God and greeted him with a kiss. <a name="4:28">4:28</a> Moses told Aaron all the words of The Lord who had sent him and all the signs that he had commanded him. <a name="4:29">4:29</a> Then Moses and Aaron went and brought together all the Israelite elders. <a name="4:30">4:30</a> Aaron spoke all the words that The Lord had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people, <a name="4:31">4:31</a> and the people believed. When they heard that The Lord had attended to the Israelites and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed down close to the ground.

## Chapter 5

### Opposition to the Plan of God

<a name="5:1">5:1</a> Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “Thus says The Lord, the God of Israel, ‘Release my people so that they may hold a pilgrim feast to me in the desert.’” <a name="5:2">5:2</a> But Pharaoh said, “Who is The Lord that I should obey him by releasing Israel? I do not know The Lord, and I will not release Israel.” <a name="5:3">5:3</a> And they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go a three-day journey into the desert so that we may sacrifice to The Lord our God, so that he does not strike us with plague or the sword.” <a name="5:4">5:4</a> Then the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you cause the people to refrain from their work? Return to your labor!” <a name="5:5">5:5</a> Pharaoh was thinking, “The people of the land are now many, and you are giving them rest from their labor.”

<a name="5:6">5:6</a> That same day Pharaoh commanded the slave masters and foremen who were over the people: <a name="5:7">5:7</a> “You must no longer give straw to the people for making bricks as before. Let them go and collect straw for themselves. <a name="5:8">5:8</a> But you must require of them the same quota of bricks that they were making before. Do not reduce it, for they are slackers. That is why they are crying, ‘Let us go sacrifice to our God.’ <a name="5:9">5:9</a> Let the work be harder for the men so they will keep at it and pay no attention to lying words!”

<a name="5:10">5:10</a> So the slave masters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, “Thus says Pharaoh: ‘I am not giving you straw. <a name="5:11">5:11</a> You go get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, because not a thing will be reduced from your workload.’” <a name="5:12">5:12</a> So the people spread out through all the land of Egypt to collect stubble for straw. <a name="5:13">5:13</a> The slave masters were pressuring them, saying, “Complete your work for each day, just like when there was straw!” <a name="5:14">5:14</a> The Israelite foremen whom Pharaoh’s slave masters had set over them were beaten and were asked, “Why did you not complete your requirement for brick making as in the past  —  both yesterday and today?”

<a name="5:15">5:15</a> The Israelite foremen went and cried out to Pharaoh, “Why are you treating your servants this way? <a name="5:16">5:16</a> No straw is given to your servants, but we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are even being beaten, but the fault is with your people.”

<a name="5:17">5:17</a> But he said, “You are slackers! Slackers! That is why you are saying, ‘Let us go sacrifice to The Lord.’ <a name="5:18">5:18</a> So now, get back to work! You will not be given straw, but you must still produce your quota of bricks!” <a name="5:19">5:19</a> The Israelite foremen saw that they were in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce the daily quota of your bricks.”

<a name="5:20">5:20</a> When they went out from Pharaoh, they encountered Moses and Aaron standing there to meet them, <a name="5:21">5:21</a> and they said to them, “May The Lord look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the opinion of Pharaoh and in the opinion of his servants, so that you have put a sword in their hand to kill us!”

### The Assurance of Deliverance

<a name="5:22">5:22</a> Moses returned to The Lord, and said, “Lord, why have you caused trouble for this people? Why did you ever send me? <a name="5:23">5:23</a> From the time I went to speak to Pharaoh in your name, he has caused trouble for this people, and you have certainly not rescued your people!”

## Chapter 6

<a name="6:1">6:1</a> Then The Lord said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for with a strong hand he will release them, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”

<a name="6:2">6:2</a> God spoke to Moses and said to him, “I am The Lord. <a name="6:3">6:3</a> I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name ‘The Lord’ I was not known to them. <a name="6:4">6:4</a> I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, in which they were living as resident aliens. <a name="6:5">6:5</a> I have also heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant. <a name="6:6">6:6</a> Therefore, say to the Israelites, ‘I am The Lord. I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, I will rescue you from the hard labor they impose, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. <a name="6:7">6:7</a> I will take you to myself for a people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am The Lord your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. <a name="6:8">6:8</a> I will bring you to the land I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob  —  and I will give it to you as a possession. I am The Lord!’”

<a name="6:9">6:9</a> Moses told this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and hard labor. <a name="6:10">6:10</a> Then The Lord said to Moses, <a name="6:11">6:11</a> “Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt that he must release the Israelites from his land.” <a name="6:12">6:12</a> But Moses responded to The Lord, “If the Israelites did not listen to me, then how will Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with difficulty?”

<a name="6:13">6:13</a> The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge for the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.

### The Ancestry of the Deliverer

<a name="6:14">6:14</a> These are the heads of their fathers’ households:

The sons of Reuben, the firstborn son of Israel, were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben.

<a name="6:15">6:15</a> The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.

<a name="6:16">6:16</a> Now these are the names of the sons of Levi, according to their records: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. (The length of Levi’s life was one hundred thirty-seven years.)

<a name="6:17">6:17</a> The sons of Gershon, by their families, were Libni and Shimei.

<a name="6:18">6:18</a> The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. (The length of Kohath’s life was one hundred thirty-three years.)

<a name="6:19">6:19</a> The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi, according to their records.

<a name="6:20">6:20</a> Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. (The length of Amram’s life was one hundred thirty-seven years.)

<a name="6:21">6:21</a> The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zikri.

<a name="6:22">6:22</a> The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.

<a name="6:23">6:23</a> Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

<a name="6:24">6:24</a> The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans.

<a name="6:25">6:25</a> Now Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel and she bore him Phinehas.

These are the heads of the fathers’ households of Levi according to their clans.

<a name="6:26">6:26</a> It was the same Aaron and Moses to whom The Lord said, “Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt according to their regiments.” <a name="6:27">6:27</a> They were the men who were speaking to Pharaoh king of Egypt, in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt. It was the same Moses and Aaron.

### The Authentication of the Word

<a name="6:28">6:28</a> When The Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, <a name="6:29">6:29</a> he said to him, “I am The Lord. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I am telling you.” <a name="6:30">6:30</a> But Moses said before The Lord, “Since I speak with difficulty, why should Pharaoh listen to me?”

## Chapter 7

<a name="7:1">7:1</a> So The Lord said to Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. <a name="7:2">7:2</a> You are to speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron is to speak to Pharaoh that he must release the Israelites from his land. <a name="7:3">7:3</a> But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and although I will multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt, <a name="7:4">7:4</a> Pharaoh will not listen to you. I will reach into Egypt and bring out my regiments, my people the Israelites, from the land of Egypt with great acts of judgment. <a name="7:5">7:5</a> Then the Egyptians will know that I am The Lord, when I extend my hand over Egypt and bring out the Israelites from among them.

<a name="7:6">7:6</a> And Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as The Lord commanded them. <a name="7:7">7:7</a> Now Moses was eighty years old and Aaron was eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.

<a name="7:8">7:8</a> The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, <a name="7:9">7:9</a> “When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Do a miracle,’ and you say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ it will become a snake.” <a name="7:10">7:10</a> When Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, they did so, just as The Lord had commanded them  —  Aaron threw down his rod before Pharaoh and his servants and it became a snake. <a name="7:11">7:11</a> Then Pharaoh also summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the magicians of Egypt by their secret arts did the same thing. <a name="7:12">7:12</a> Each man threw down his rod, and the rods became snakes. But Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods. <a name="7:13">7:13</a> Yet Pharaoh’s heart became hard, and he did not listen to them, just as The Lord had predicted.

### The First Blow: Water to Blood

<a name="7:14">7:14</a> The Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is hard; he refuses to release the people. <a name="7:15">7:15</a> Go to Pharaoh in the morning when he goes out to the water. Position yourself to meet him by the edge of the Nile, and take in your hand the rod that was turned into a snake. <a name="7:16">7:16</a> Say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you to say, “Release my people, that they may serve me in the desert!” But until now you have not listened. <a name="7:17">7:17</a> Thus says The Lord: “By this you will know that I am The Lord: I am going to strike the water of the Nile with the rod that is in my hand, and it will be turned into blood. <a name="7:18">7:18</a> Fish in the Nile will die, the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from the Nile.”’” <a name="7:19">7:19</a> Then The Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and stretch out your hand over Egypt’s water  —  over their rivers, over their canals, over their ponds, and over all their reservoirs  —  so that it becomes blood.’ There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in wooden and stone containers.” <a name="7:20">7:20</a> Moses and Aaron did so, just as The Lord had commanded. Moses raised the rod and struck the water that was in the Nile right before Pharaoh’s eyes and before the eyes of his servants, and all the water that was in the Nile was turned to blood. <a name="7:21">7:21</a> When the fish that were in the Nile died, the Nile began to stink, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt! <a name="7:22">7:22</a> But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts, and so Pharaoh’s heart remained hard, and he did not listen to Moses and Aaron  —  just as The Lord had said. <a name="7:23">7:23</a> And Pharaoh turned and went into his house. He did not take even this to heart. <a name="7:24">7:24</a> All the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, because they could not drink the water of the Nile.

## Chapter 8

### The Second Blow: Frogs

<a name="7:25">7:25</a> Seven full days passed after The Lord struck the Nile. <a name="8:1">8:1</a> Then The Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says The Lord: “Release my people in order that they may serve me. <a name="8:2">8:2</a> But if you refuse to release them, then I am going to plague all your territory with frogs. <a name="8:3">8:3</a> The Nile will swarm with frogs, and they will go up and come into your house, in your bedroom, and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and your people, and into your ovens and your kneading troughs. <a name="8:4">8:4</a> Frogs will go up against you, your people, and all your servants.”’”

<a name="8:5">8:5</a> The Lord spoke to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Extend your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the canals, and over the ponds, and bring the frogs up over the land of Egypt.’” <a name="8:6">8:6</a> So Aaron extended his hand over the waters of Egypt, and frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.

<a name="8:7">8:7</a> The magicians did the same with their secret arts and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt too.

<a name="8:8">8:8</a> Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to The Lord that he may take away the frogs from me and my people, and I will release the people that they may sacrifice to The Lord.” <a name="8:9">8:9</a> Moses said to Pharaoh, “You may have the honor over me  —  when shall I pray for you, your servants, and your people, for the frogs to be removed from you and your houses, so that they will be left only in the Nile?” <a name="8:10">8:10</a> He said, “Tomorrow.” And Moses said, “It will be according to your word, so that you may know that there is no one like The Lord our God. <a name="8:11">8:11</a> The frogs will depart from you, your houses, your servants, and your people; they will be left only in the Nile.”

<a name="8:12">8:12</a> Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to The Lord because of the frogs that he had brought on Pharaoh. <a name="8:13">8:13</a> The Lord did according to Moses’ word  —  the frogs died out of the houses, the villages, and the fields. <a name="8:14">8:14</a> The Egyptians piled them in countless heaps, and the land stank. <a name="8:15">8:15</a> But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, just as The Lord had predicted.

### The Third Blow: Gnats

<a name="8:16">8:16</a> The Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Extend your rod and strike the dust of the ground, and it will become gnats in all the land of Egypt.’” <a name="8:17">8:17</a> They did so; Aaron extended his hand with his rod, he struck the dust of the ground, and it became gnats on people and on animals. All the dust of the ground became gnats in all the land of Egypt. <a name="8:18">8:18</a> When the magicians did so to bring forth gnats with their secret arts, they could not. So there were gnats on people and on animals. <a name="8:19">8:19</a> The magicians said to Pharaoh, “It is the finger of God!” But Pharaoh’s heart remained hard, and he did not listen to them, just as The Lord had predicted.

### The Fourth Blow: Flies

<a name="8:20">8:20</a> The Lord said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and take your position before Pharaoh as he goes out to the water, and say to him, ‘Thus says The Lord, “Release my people that they may serve me. <a name="8:21">8:21</a> If you do not release my people, then I am going to send swarms of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and in your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and even the ground where they stand. <a name="8:22">8:22</a> But on that day I will mark off the land of Goshen, where my people are staying, so that no swarms of flies will be there, that you may know that I am The Lord in the midst of the earth. <a name="8:23">8:23</a> I will put a division between my people and your people. This sign will take place tomorrow.”’” <a name="8:24">8:24</a> The Lord did so; a thick swarm of flies came into Pharaoh’s house and into the houses of his servants, and throughout all the land of Egypt the land was ruined because of the swarms of flies.

<a name="8:25">8:25</a> Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.” <a name="8:26">8:26</a> But Moses said, “That would not be the right thing to do, for the sacrifices we make to The Lord our God would be an abomination to the Egyptians. If we make sacrifices that are an abomination to the Egyptians right before their eyes, will they not stone us? <a name="8:27">8:27</a> We must go on a three day journey into the desert and sacrifice to The Lord our God, just as he is telling us.”

<a name="8:28">8:28</a> Pharaoh said, “I will release you so that you may sacrifice to The Lord your God in the desert. Only you must not go very far. Do pray for me.”

<a name="8:29">8:29</a> Moses said, “I am going to go out from you and pray to The Lord, and the swarms of flies will go away from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh deal falsely again by not releasing the people to sacrifice to The Lord.” <a name="8:30">8:30</a> So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to The Lord, <a name="8:31">8:31</a> and The Lord did according to Moses’ word  —  he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained. <a name="8:32">8:32</a> But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and did not release the people.

### The Fifth Blow: Disease

## Chapter 9

<a name="9:1">9:1</a> Then The Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him, ‘Thus says The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, “Release my people that they may serve me. <a name="9:2">9:2</a> For if you refuse to release them and continue holding them, <a name="9:3">9:3</a> then the hand of The Lord will surely bring a very terrible plague on your livestock in the field, on the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks. <a name="9:4">9:4</a> But the Lord will distinguish between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and nothing will die of all that the Israelites have.”’”

<a name="9:5">9:5</a> The Lord set an appointed time, saying, “Tomorrow The Lord will do this in the land.” <a name="9:6">9:6</a> And The Lord did this on the next day; all the livestock of the Egyptians died, but of the Israelites’ livestock not one died! <a name="9:7">9:7</a> Pharaoh sent representatives to investigate, and indeed, not even one of the livestock of Israel had died. But Pharaoh’s heart remained hard, and he did not release the people.

### The Sixth Blow: Boils

<a name="9:8">9:8</a> Then The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a furnace, and have Moses throw it into the air while Pharaoh is watching. <a name="9:9">9:9</a> It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt and will cause boils to break out and fester on both people and animals in all the land of Egypt.” <a name="9:10">9:10</a> So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh, Moses threw it into the air, and it caused festering boils to break out on both people and animals.

<a name="9:11">9:11</a> The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians. <a name="9:12">9:12</a> But The Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not listen to them, just as The Lord had predicted to Moses.

### The Seventh Blow: Hail

<a name="9:13">9:13</a> The Lord said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus says The Lord, the God of the Hebrews: “Release my people so that they may serve me! <a name="9:14">9:14</a> For this time I will send all my plagues on your very self and on your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth. <a name="9:15">9:15</a> For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with plague, and you would have been destroyed from the earth. <a name="9:16">9:16</a> But for this purpose I have caused you to stand: to show you my strength, and so that my name may be declared in all the earth. <a name="9:17">9:17</a> You are still exalting yourself against my people by not releasing them. <a name="9:18">9:18</a> I am going to cause very severe hail to rain down about this time tomorrow, such hail as has never been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. <a name="9:19">9:19</a> So now, send instructions to gather your livestock and all your possessions in the fields to a safe place. Every person or animal caught in the field and not brought into the house — the hail will come down on them, and they will die!”’”

<a name="9:20">9:20</a> Those of Pharaoh’s servants who feared the word of The Lord hurried to bring their servants and livestock into the houses, <a name="9:21">9:21</a> but those who did not take the word of The Lord to heart left their servants and their cattle in the field.

<a name="9:22">9:22</a> Then The Lord said to Moses, “Extend your hand toward the sky that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on people and on animals, and on everything that grows in the field in the land of Egypt.” <a name="9:23">9:23</a> When Moses extended his rod toward the sky, The Lord sent thunder and hail, and fire fell to the earth; so The Lord caused hail to rain down on the land of Egypt. <a name="9:24">9:24</a> Hail fell and fire mingled with the hail; the hail was so severe that there had not been any like it in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation. <a name="9:25">9:25</a> The hail struck everything in the open fields, both people and animals, throughout all the land of Egypt. Everything that grows in the field the hail struck, and it broke all the trees of the field to pieces. <a name="9:26">9:26</a> Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, was there no hail.

<a name="9:27">9:27</a> So Pharaoh sent and summoned Moses and Aaron and said to them, “I have sinned this time! The Lord is righteous, and I and my people are guilty. <a name="9:28">9:28</a> Pray to The Lord, for the mighty thunderings and hail are too much! I will release you and you will stay no longer.”

<a name="9:29">9:29</a> Moses said to him, “When I leave the city I will spread my hands to The Lord, the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth belongs to The Lord. <a name="9:30">9:30</a> But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear The Lord God.”

<a name="9:31">9:31</a> (Now the flax and the barley were struck by the hail, for the barley had formed ears, and the flax was in bud. <a name="9:32">9:32</a> But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they are later crops.)

<a name="9:33">9:33</a> So Moses left Pharaoh, went out of the city, and spread out his hands to The Lord, and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain stopped pouring on the earth. <a name="9:34">9:34</a> When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder ceased, he sinned again: both he and his servants hardened their hearts. <a name="9:35">9:35</a> So Pharaoh’s heart remained hard, and he did not release the Israelites, as The Lord had spoken by the hand of Moses.

### The Eighth Blow: Locusts

## Chapter 10

<a name="10:1">10:1</a> The Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, in order to display these signs of mine before him, <a name="10:2">10:2</a> and in order that in the hearing of your son and your grandson you may tell how I made fools of the Egyptians and about my signs that I displayed among them, so that you may know that I am The Lord.”

<a name="10:3">10:3</a> So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says The Lord, the God of the Hebrews: ‘How long do you refuse to humble yourself before me? Release my people so that they may serve me! <a name="10:4">10:4</a> But if you refuse to release my people, I am going to bring locusts into your territory tomorrow. <a name="10:5">10:5</a> They will cover the surface of the earth, so that one will be unable to see the ground. They will eat the remainder of what escaped  —  what is left over for you  —  from the hail, and they will eat every tree that grows for you from the field. <a name="10:6">10:6</a> They will fill your houses, the houses of your servants, and all the houses of Egypt, such as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen since they have been in the land until this day!’” Then Moses turned and went out from Pharaoh.

<a name="10:7">10:7</a> Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Release the people so that they may serve The Lord their God. Do you not know that Egypt is destroyed?”

<a name="10:8">10:8</a> So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve The Lord your God. Exactly who is going with you?” <a name="10:9">10:9</a> Moses said, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our sheep and our cattle we will go, because we are to hold a pilgrim feast for The Lord.”

<a name="10:10">10:10</a> He said to them, “The Lord will need to be with you if I release you and your dependents! Watch out! Trouble is right in front of you! <a name="10:11">10:11</a> No! Go, you men only, and serve The Lord, for that is what you want.” Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh’s presence.

<a name="10:12">10:12</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Extend your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up over the land of Egypt and eat everything that grows in the ground, all that the hail has left.” <a name="10:13">10:13</a> So Moses extended his rod over the land of Egypt, and then The Lord brought an east wind on the land all that day and all night. The morning came, and the east wind had brought up the locusts! <a name="10:14">10:14</a> The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and settled down in all the territory of Egypt. It was very severe; there had been no locusts like them before, nor will there be such ever again. <a name="10:15">10:15</a> They covered the surface of all the ground, so that the ground became dark, and they ate all the vegetation of the ground and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Nothing green remained on the trees or on anything that grew in the fields throughout all the land of Egypt.

<a name="10:16">10:16</a> Then Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against The Lord your God and against you! <a name="10:17">10:17</a> So now, forgive my sin this time only, and pray to The Lord your God that he may take away from me this death only.” <a name="10:18">10:18</a> Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to The Lord. <a name="10:19">10:19</a> And The Lord turned a very strong sea wind and it picked up the locusts and threw them into the Red Sea. Not one locust remained in all the territory of Egypt. <a name="10:20">10:20</a> But The Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not release the Israelites.

### The Ninth Blow: Darkness

<a name="10:21">10:21</a> The Lord said to Moses, “Extend your hand toward heaven so that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness that can be felt.”

<a name="10:22">10:22</a> So Moses extended his hand toward heaven, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days. <a name="10:23">10:23</a> No one could see another person, and no one could rise from his place for three days. But the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.

<a name="10:24">10:24</a> Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, serve The Lord  —  only your flocks and herds will be detained. Even your families may go with you.”

<a name="10:25">10:25</a> But Moses said, “Will you also provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may present them to The Lord our God? <a name="10:26">10:26</a> Our livestock must also go with us! Not a hoof is to be left behind! For we must take these animals to serve The Lord our God. Until we arrive there, we do not know what we must use to serve The Lord.”

<a name="10:27">10:27</a> But The Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to release them. <a name="10:28">10:28</a> Pharaoh said to him, “Go from me! Watch out for yourself! Do not appear before me again, for when you see my face you will die!” <a name="10:29">10:29</a> Moses said, “As you wish! I will not see your face again.”

### The Tenth Blow: Death

## Chapter 11

<a name="11:1">11:1</a> The Lord said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will release you from this place. When he releases you, he will drive you out completely from this place. <a name="11:2">11:2</a> Instruct the people that each man is to request from his neighbor, and each woman from her neighbor, items of silver and gold.”

<a name="11:3">11:3</a> (Now The Lord granted the people favor with the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, respected by Pharaoh’s servants and by the Egyptian people.)

<a name="11:4">11:4</a> Moses said, “Thus says The Lord: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt, <a name="11:5">11:5</a> and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, to the firstborn son of the slave girl who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle. <a name="11:6">11:6</a> There will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has never been, nor ever will be again. <a name="11:7">11:7</a> But against any of the Israelites not even a dog will bark against either people or animals, so that you may know that The Lord distinguishes between Egypt and Israel.’ <a name="11:8">11:8</a> All these your servants will come down to me and bow down to me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you,’ and after that I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in great anger.

<a name="11:9">11:9</a> The Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”

<a name="11:10">11:10</a> So Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but The Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not release the Israelites from his land.

## Chapter 12

### The Institution of the Passover

<a name="12:1">12:1</a> The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, <a name="12:2">12:2</a> “This month for you is to be the beginning of months; it will be your first month of the year. <a name="12:3">12:3</a> Tell all the congregation of Israel, ‘In the tenth day of this month they each must take a lamb for themselves according to the house of their fathers  —  a lamb for a house. <a name="12:4">12:4</a> If any household is too small for a lamb, the man and his neighbor who lives nearby are to take a lamb according to the number of people  —  you will make your count for the lamb according to how much each one can eat. <a name="12:5">12:5</a> Your lamb must be perfect, a male, one year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. <a name="12:6">12:6</a> You must care for it until the fourteenth day of this month, and then all the congregation of the assembly of Israel will kill it between the evenings. <a name="12:7">12:7</a> They will take some of the blood and put it on the two side posts and on the lintel of the houses in which they will eat it. <a name="12:8">12:8</a> They will eat the meat the same night; they will eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened cakes and with bitter herbs. <a name="12:9">12:9</a> Do not eat it raw or boiled in water, but roast it over the fire with its head, its legs, and its entrails. <a name="12:10">12:10</a> You must leave nothing until morning, but you must burn with fire whatever remains of it until morning. <a name="12:11">12:11</a> And this is how you are to eat it  —  dressed to travel, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You are to eat it in haste. It is the Passover of The Lord.

<a name="12:12">12:12</a> I will pass through the land of Egypt in the same night, and I will kill all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both of humans and of animals, and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment. I am The Lord. <a name="12:13">12:13</a> The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, so that when I see the blood I will pass over you, and this plague will not fall on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.

<a name="12:14">12:14</a> This day will become a memorial for you, and you will celebrate it as a festival to The Lord  —  you will celebrate the feast perpetually as a lasting ordinance. <a name="12:15">12:15</a> For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast. Surely on the first day you must put away the yeast from your houses because anyone who eats leavened bread from the first day to the seventh day may be cut off from Israel.

<a name="12:16">12:16</a> And on the first day there will be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there will be a holy convocation for you. You must do no work of any kind on them, only what every person must eat  —  that alone may be prepared for you. <a name="12:17">12:17</a> And you will keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because on this same day I brought your multitudes out from the land of Egypt, and so you must keep this day perpetually as a lasting ordinance. <a name="12:18">12:18</a> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, you will eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening. <a name="12:19">12:19</a> For seven days leaven must not be found in your houses, for whoever eats what is leavened  —  that person will be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether a foreigner or one born in the land. <a name="12:20">12:20</a> You will not eat anything leavened; in all the places where you live you must eat unleavened bread.”

<a name="12:21">12:21</a> Then Moses summoned the elders of Israel, and said to them, “Draw out and take small animals for yourselves according to your families, and kill the Passover animals. <a name="12:22">12:22</a> Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply to the lintel and the two side posts blood that is in the basin. And none of you will go out the door of his house until morning. <a name="12:23">12:23</a> For The Lord will pass through to strike Egypt; and when he sees the blood on the lintel and the two side posts, then The Lord will pass over the door, and he will not permit destroyer to enter into your houses to strike you. <a name="12:24">12:24</a> And you will observe this event as an ordinance for you and for your children forever. <a name="12:25">12:25</a> And when you enter the land that The Lord will give to you, just as he said, then you must observe this service. <a name="12:26">12:26</a> And when your children say to you, “What does this service mean to you?”  —  <a name="12:27">12:27</a> then you will say, ‘It is the sacrifice of The Lord’s Passover, when he passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt, when he destroyed Egypt and delivered our households.’” And the people bowed down low to the ground. <a name="12:28">12:28</a> And then the Israelites went away and did exactly as The Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.

### The Deliverance from Egypt

<a name="12:29">12:29</a> It happened at midnight  —  The Lord struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the prison, and all the firstborn of the cattle. <a name="12:30">12:30</a> And Pharaoh got up in the night, along with all his servants and all Egypt, and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no house in which there was not someone dead. <a name="12:31">12:31</a> And he summoned Moses and Aaron in the night, and said, “Get up, get out from among my people, both you and your children! Go and serve The Lord as you have spoken! <a name="12:32">12:32</a> Also, take your flocks and your herds, just as you have spoken, and leave. But bless me also.”

<a name="12:33">12:33</a> And the Egyptians were urging on the people, in order to send them out of the land quickly, for they were saying, “We are all dead people!” <a name="12:34">12:34</a> And the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading troughs bound up in their clothes on their shoulders. <a name="12:35">12:35</a> And the Israelites had done according to the word of Moses  —  they had asked from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing. <a name="12:36">12:36</a> The Lord gave favor to the people in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they gave them whatever they wanted, and so they plundered Egypt.

<a name="12:37">12:37</a> The Israelites journeyed from Rameses and Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children. <a name="12:38">12:38</a> And a mixed multitude also went up with them, and flocks and herds  —  a very large number of cattle. <a name="12:39">12:39</a> And they baked cakes of unleavened bread with the dough they had brought from Egypt, for it was not leavened  —  because they were thrust out of Egypt and were not able to delay, they could not prepare food for themselves either.

<a name="12:40">12:40</a> Now the length of time the Israelites lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years. <a name="12:41">12:41</a> And at the end of the four hundred thirty years, on the same day, all the divisions of The Lord went out of the land of Egypt. <a name="12:42">12:42</a> It was a night of watching for The Lord to bring them out from the land of Egypt; and so on this night all Israel is to keep the vigil to The Lord for generations to come.

### Participation in the Passover

<a name="12:43">12:43</a> And The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner may share in eating it. <a name="12:44">12:44</a> But everyone’s servant who is bought for money, after you have circumcised him, may eat it. <a name="12:45">12:45</a> A foreigner and a hired worker must not eat it. <a name="12:46">12:46</a> It must be eaten in one house; you must not carry it around outside from one house to another. And you must not break a bone of it. <a name="12:47">12:47</a> The congregation of Israel must observe it.

<a name="12:48">12:48</a> “And when a foreigner lives with you, and wants to observe the Passover to The Lord, all his males must be circumcised, and then he may come near and observe it, and he will be as one who is born in the land  —  for no uncircumcised person may eat of it. <a name="12:49">12:49</a> The same law will apply to the person who is native-born and to the foreigner who lives among you.”

<a name="12:50">12:50</a> So all the Israelites did exactly as The Lord commanded Moses and Aaron. <a name="12:51">12:51</a> And on that very day The Lord brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their divisions.

## Chapter 13

### The Law of the Firstborn

<a name="13:1">13:1</a> The Lord spoke to Moses: <a name="13:2">13:2</a> “Sanctify to me every firstborn male  —  whatever opens every womb among the Israelites, whether human or animal, is mine.”

<a name="13:3">13:3</a> And Moses said to the people, “Remember this day in which you came out from Egypt, from the place where you were enslaved, for The Lord brought you out of there with a mighty hand  —  and no leavened bread may be eaten. <a name="13:4">13:4</a> On this day, in the month of Abib, you are going out.

<a name="13:5">13:5</a> When The Lord brings you to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, then you will keep this service in this month. <a name="13:6">13:6</a> For seven days you will eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there is to be a festival to The Lord. <a name="13:7">13:7</a> Unleavened bread must be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread will be seen by you, nor will leaven be seen by you within any of your borders.

<a name="13:8">13:8</a> And you are to tell your son on that day, ‘It is because of what The Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.’ <a name="13:9">13:9</a> And it will be a sign for you on your hand, and a memorial between your eyes, so that the law of The Lord may be in your mouth, for with a mighty hand The Lord brought you out of Egypt.

<a name="13:10">13:10</a> So you must keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year.

<a name="13:11">13:11</a> When The Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you, <a name="13:12">13:12</a> then you must give over to The Lord everything that opens the womb. Every firstling of beasts that you have  —  the males will be The Lord’s. <a name="13:13">13:13</a> Every firstling of a donkey you must redeem with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, then you must break its neck. Every firstborn of your sons you must redeem.

<a name="13:14">13:14</a> When your son asks you in time to come, ‘What is this?’ you are to say to him, ‘With a mighty hand The Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the land of bondage. <a name="13:15">13:15</a> When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to release us, The Lord killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of people even to the firstborn of animals. That is why I am sacrificing to The Lord every male that opens the womb, but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.’ <a name="13:16">13:16</a> And it will be for a sign on your hand, and for frontlets between your eyes, for with a mighty hand The Lord brought us out of Egypt.”

### The Leading of God

<a name="13:17">13:17</a> When Pharaoh released the people, God did not lead them on the way to the land of the Philistines, although that was nearby, for God said, “Lest the people change their minds when they experience war, and return to Egypt.” <a name="13:18">13:18</a> And so God led the people around on the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea. And the Israelites went up from the land of Egypt prepared for battle.

<a name="13:19">13:19</a> And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the Israelites solemnly swear, “God will surely visit you, and you will carry my bones up from this place with you.”

<a name="13:20">13:20</a> So they journeyed from Sukkoth and camped in Etham, on the edge of the desert. <a name="13:21">13:21</a> Now The Lord was going before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them in the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could go day or night. <a name="13:22">13:22</a> He did not take away from before the people the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night.

## Chapter 14

### The Victory at the Red Sea

<a name="14:1">14:1</a> And The Lord spoke to Moses: <a name="14:2">14:2</a> “Tell the Israelites that they may turn and camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; opposite Baal Zephon you are to camp by the sea. <a name="14:3">14:3</a> And Pharaoh will think that the Israelites are wandering around confused in the land  —  the desert has closed in on them. <a name="14:4">14:4</a> And I will harden the heart of Pharaoh and he will chase after them, and I will be honored because of Pharaoh and because of his army; and the Egyptians will know that I am The Lord.” So this is what they did.

<a name="14:5">14:5</a> It was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people. So he said, “What in the world have we done? For we have released the people of Israel from serving us!” <a name="14:6">14:6</a> Then he prepared his chariots and took his army with him. <a name="14:7">14:7</a> And he took six hundred of the best chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and officers on all of them.

<a name="14:8">14:8</a> But The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt; and he chased after the Israelites. Now the Israelites were going out defiantly. <a name="14:9">14:9</a> And the Egyptians chased after them, and all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-Zephon. <a name="14:10">14:10</a> When Pharaoh got closer, the Israelites looked up and saw that the Egyptians were marching after them. They were terrified. Then the Israelites cried out to The Lord. <a name="14:11">14:11</a> And they said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you took us away to die in the desert? What in the world have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? <a name="14:12">14:12</a> Was this not what we told you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians?’ For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”

<a name="14:13">14:13</a> And Moses said to the people, “Do not fear! Stand firm and see the salvation of The Lord that he will provide for you today; for the Egyptians that you see today you will never, ever see again. <a name="14:14">14:14</a> The Lord will fight for you, and you can be still.”

<a name="14:15">14:15</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Why do you cry out to me? Tell the Israelites to go forward. <a name="14:16">14:16</a> But as for you, lift up your rod and extend your hand toward the sea and divide it, so that the Israelites may go in the midst of the sea on dry ground. <a name="14:17">14:17</a> But I am going to harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will pursue them, that I may be honored because of Pharaoh and because of his army and because of his chariots and because of his horsemen. <a name="14:18">14:18</a> And the Egyptians will know that I am The Lord when I have gained my honor because of Pharaoh, because of his chariots, and because of his horsemen.”

<a name="14:19">14:19</a> The angel of God, who was going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them, and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them. <a name="14:20">14:20</a> It came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; it was a dark cloud and it lit up the night so that one camp did not come near the other the whole night. <a name="14:21">14:21</a> And Moses stretched out his hand toward the sea, and The Lord caused the sea to go apart by a strong east wind all that night, and he made the sea into dry land, and the waters were divided. <a name="14:22">14:22</a> So the Israelites went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters forming a wall for them on their right and on their left.

<a name="14:23">14:23</a> And the Egyptians chased after them; they went into the midst of the sea after them  —  all the horses of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen. <a name="14:24">14:24</a> And in the morning watch The Lord looked down on the host of Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud, and he threw the Egyptians into a panic. <a name="14:25">14:25</a> He jammed the wheels of their chariots so they had difficulty driving, and the Egyptians said, “Let’s flee from the presence of Israel, for The Lord fights for them against Egypt.”

<a name="14:26">14:26</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Extend your hand toward the sea, so that the waters may flow back on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen!” <a name="14:27">14:27</a> So Moses extended his hand toward the sea, and the sea returned to its normal state when morning appeared. Now the Egyptians were fleeing before it, but The Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. <a name="14:28">14:28</a> The waters returned and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that was pursuing the Israelites into the sea  —  not so much as one of them survived. <a name="14:29">14:29</a> But the Israelites walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea  —  the waters were like a wall to them on their right hand and on their left hand. <a name="14:30">14:30</a> So The Lord saved Israel on that day from the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore of the sea. <a name="14:31">14:31</a> When Israel saw the great power that The Lord had exercised over the Egyptians, they feared The Lord, and they believed in The Lord and in his servant Moses.

## Chapter 15

### The Song of Triumph

<a name="15:1">15:1</a> Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord:

> “I will sing to The Lord for he has triumphed gloriously,
> the horse and its rider he has thrown into the sea.
> <a name="15:2">15:2</a> The Lord is my strength and my song,
> and he has become my salvation.
> This is my God, and I will praise him,
> my father’s God, and I will exalt him.
> <a name="15:3">15:3</a> The Lord is a man of war,
> The Lord is his name.
> <a name="15:4">15:4</a> The chariots of Pharaoh and his army he has thrown into the sea,
> and his chosen officers were drowned in the Red Sea.
> <a name="15:5">15:5</a> The depths have covered over them,
> they went down to the bottom like a stone.
> <a name="15:6">15:6</a> Your right hand, O Lord, was majestic in power,
> your right hand, O Lord, shattered the enemy.
> <a name="15:7">15:7</a> And in the greatness of your majesty you have overthrown
> those who rise up against you.
> You sent forth your wrath;
> it consumed them like stubble.
> <a name="15:8">15:8</a> And by the blast of your nostrils the waters were piled up,
> the waters stood upright like a heap,
> and the deep waters were congealed in the heart of the sea.
> <a name="15:9">15:9</a> The enemy said, “I will chase, I will overtake,
> I will divide the spoil;
> my desire will be satisfied on them.
> I will draw my sword, my hand will destroy them.”
> <a name="15:10">15:10</a> But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them.
> They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
> <a name="15:11">15:11</a> Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?
> Who is like you?  —  majestic in holiness,
> fearful in praises, working wonders?
> <a name="15:12">15:12</a> You stretched out your right hand,
> the earth swallowed them.
> <a name="15:13">15:13</a> By your loyal love you will lead the people
> whom you have redeemed;
> you will guide them by your strength to your holy habitation.
> <a name="15:14">15:14</a> The people will hear and be afraid;
> anguish will take hold of the inhabitants of Philistia.
> <a name="15:15">15:15</a> Then the chiefs of Edom will be terrified,
> the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling,
> and the inhabitants of Canaan will melt away.
> <a name="15:16">15:16</a> Fear and dread will fall on them;
> by the greatness of your arm they will be as still as stone
> until your people pass over, O Lord,
> until the people pass over, which you have bought.
> <a name="15:17">15:17</a> You will bring them in
> and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance,
> in the place, O Lord, you made for your residence,
> the sanctuary, O Lord, your hands have established.
> <a name="15:18">15:18</a> The Lord will reign forever and ever!
> <a name="15:19">15:19</a> For the horses of Pharaoh went
> with his chariots and his footmen into the seas,
> and The Lord brought again the waters of the sea on them,
> but the Israelites went on dry land in the midst of the sea.”

<a name="15:20">15:20</a> Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a hand-drum in her hand, and all the women went out after her with hand-drums and with dances. <a name="15:21">15:21</a> And Miriam sang in response to them, 

> “Sing to The Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and its rider he has thrown into the sea.”

### The Bitter Water

<a name="15:22">15:22</a> Then Moses caused Israel to journey from the Red Sea, and they went out into the desert of Shur. They went three days into the desert, and they found no water. <a name="15:23">15:23</a> Then they came to Marah, but they were not able to drink the waters of Marah, because they were bitter. (That is why its name was called Marah.)

<a name="15:24">15:24</a> So the people murmured against Moses, saying, “What can we drink?” <a name="15:25">15:25</a> Moses cried out to The Lord, and The Lord showed him a tree. When he threw it into the waters, the waters became safe to drink. There he made for them a binding ordinance, and there he tested them, <a name="15:26">15:26</a> and said, “If you will diligently obey The Lord your God, and do what is right in his eyes, and give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, then all the diseases that I put on the Egyptians I will not put on you, for I, The Lord, am your healer.”

<a name="15:27">15:27</a> Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees. And they camped there by the waters.

## Chapter 16

### The Provision of Manna

<a name="16:1">16:1</a> When they journeyed from Elim, the entire company of Israelites came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their exodus from the land of Egypt. <a name="16:2">16:2</a> And the entire company of Israelites murmured against Moses and Aaron in the desert. <a name="16:3">16:3</a> The Israelites said to them, “Oh that we had died by the hand of The Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat, and when we ate bread to the full! But you have brought us out into this desert to kill this whole assembly with hunger!”

<a name="16:4">16:4</a> Then The Lord said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people will go out and gather a certain amount each day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not. <a name="16:5">16:5</a> And on the sixth day they will prepare what they bring in, and it will be twice as much as they gather each day.”

<a name="16:6">16:6</a> And Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know that The Lord has brought you out of the land of Egypt. <a name="16:7">16:7</a> And in the morning you will see the glory of The Lord, because he heard your murmurings against The Lord. And what are we, that you should murmur against us?”

<a name="16:8">16:8</a> And Moses said, “You will know this when The Lord gives you meat to eat in the evening, and bread in the morning to satisfy you, because The Lord heard your murmurings that you are murmuring against him. And what are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against The Lord.”

<a name="16:9">16:9</a> Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to all the community of the Israelites, ‘Come before The Lord, because he has heard your murmurings.’”

<a name="16:10">16:10</a> And as Aaron spoke to the whole community of the Israelites, they looked toward the desert, and there the glory of The Lord appeared in the cloud. <a name="16:11">16:11</a> Then The Lord spoke to Moses: <a name="16:12">16:12</a> “I have heard the murmurings of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘During the evening you will eat flesh, and in the morning you will be satisfied with bread, so that you may know that I am The Lord your God.”

<a name="16:13">16:13</a> And in the evening the quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning a layer of dew was all around the camp. <a name="16:14">16:14</a> When the layer of dew had evaporated, there were small round things on the surface of the desert, small like the frost on the earth. <a name="16:15">16:15</a> When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” because they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “It is the bread that The Lord has given you for food.

<a name="16:16">16:16</a> “This is what The Lord has commanded: ‘Each person is to gather from it what he can eat, an omer per person according to the number of your people; each one will pick it up for whoever lives in his tent.’” <a name="16:17">16:17</a> And the Israelites did so, and they gathered  —  some more, some less. <a name="16:18">16:18</a> When they measured with an omer, the one who gathered much had nothing left over, and the one who gathered little lacked nothing; each one gathered what he could eat.

<a name="16:19">16:19</a> And Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it until morning.” <a name="16:20">16:20</a> But they did not listen to Moses, and some kept part of it until morning. It was full of worms and began to stink. And Moses was angry with them. <a name="16:21">16:21</a> So they gathered it each morning, each person according to what he could eat; and when the sun got hot, it melted. <a name="16:22">16:22</a> And on the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, two omers per person; and all the leaders of the community came and told Moses. <a name="16:23">16:23</a> And he said to them, “This is what The Lord has said: ‘Tomorrow is a time of cessation, a holy Sabbath to The Lord. Whatever you want to bake, bake today; and whatever you want to boil, boil today; and whatever is left put aside for yourselves to be kept until morning.’”

<a name="16:24">16:24</a> So they put it aside until the morning, just as Moses had commanded, and it did not stink, nor was there any worm in it. <a name="16:25">16:25</a> And Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to The Lord; today you will not find it in the area. <a name="16:26">16:26</a> Six days you will gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.”

<a name="16:27">16:27</a> And on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather it, but they found nothing. <a name="16:28">16:28</a> So The Lord said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to obey my commandments and my instructions? <a name="16:29">16:29</a> See, because The Lord has given you the Sabbath, that is why he is giving you food for two days on the sixth day. So each of you stay where he is; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.” <a name="16:30">16:30</a> So the people rested on the seventh day.

<a name="16:31">16:31</a> So the Israelites called its name “manna.” Now it was like coriander seed, white, and it tasted like wafers and honey.

<a name="16:32">16:32</a> Then Moses said, “This is what The Lord has commanded: ‘Fill an omer with it to be kept for generations to come, so that they may see the food I fed you in the desert when I brought you out from the land of Egypt.’” <a name="16:33">16:33</a> Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put in it an omer full of manna, and place it before The Lord to be kept for generations to come.” <a name="16:34">16:34</a> Just as The Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the Testimony for safekeeping.

<a name="16:35">16:35</a> Now the Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was inhabited; they ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan. <a name="16:36">16:36</a> Now an omer is one tenth of an ephah.

## Chapter 17

### Water at Massa and Meribah

<a name="17:1">17:1</a> And all the community of the Israelites traveled on their journey from the Desert of Sin according to the instruction of The Lord, and they pitched camp in Rephidim. Now there was no water for the people to drink. <a name="17:2">17:2</a> So the people strove with Moses, and they said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you strive with me? Why do you test The Lord?” <a name="17:3">17:3</a> But the people thirsted there for water, and they murmured against Moses and said, “Why in the world did you bring us up out of Egypt  —  to kill us and our sons and our cattle with thirst?”

<a name="17:4">17:4</a> Then Moses cried out to The Lord, “What will I do with this people?  —  a little more and they will stone me!” <a name="17:5">17:5</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Go over before the people; take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand your rod with which you struck the Nile and go. <a name="17:6">17:6</a> I will be standing before you there on the rock in Horeb, and you will strike the rock, and water will come out of it so that the people may drink.” And Moses did so in plain view of the elders of Israel.

<a name="17:7">17:7</a> And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the Israelites, and because of their testing The Lord, saying, “Is The Lord in our midst or not?”

### Victory over the Amalekites

<a name="17:8">17:8</a> Amalek came and attacked Israel in Rephidim. <a name="17:9">17:9</a> So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out, fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.”

<a name="17:10">17:10</a> So Joshua fought against Amalek just as Moses had instructed him; and Moses and Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill. <a name="17:11">17:11</a> And whenever Moses would raise his hands, then Israel prevailed; but whenever he would rest his hands, then Amalek prevailed. <a name="17:12">17:12</a> When the hands of Moses became heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side and one on the other, and so his hands were steady until the sun went down. <a name="17:13">17:13</a> So Joshua destroyed Amalek and his army with the edge of the sword.

<a name="17:14">17:14</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Write this as a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in Joshua’s hearing; for I will surely wipe out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens. <a name="17:15">17:15</a> And Moses built an altar; and he called it “The Lord is my Banner,” <a name="17:16">17:16</a> for he said, “For a hand was lifted up to the throne of The Lord  —  that The Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.”

## Chapter 18

### The Advice of Jethro

<a name="18:1">18:1</a> Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard about all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, that he had brought Israel out of Egypt.

<a name="18:2">18:2</a> Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, had taken Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back, <a name="18:3">18:3</a> and her two sons, one of whom was named Gershom (for Moses had said, “I have been an alien in a foreign land”), <a name="18:4">18:4</a> and the other Eliezer (for Moses had said, “The God of my father has been my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”).

<a name="18:5">18:5</a> And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, together with his sons and his wife, came to Moses in the desert where he was camping by the mountain of God. <a name="18:6">18:6</a> And he said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you, along with your wife and her two sons with her.” <a name="18:7">18:7</a> And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him; they asked each other how they were, and then they went into the tent. <a name="18:8">18:8</a> And Moses told his father-in-law all that The Lord had done to Pharaoh and to Egypt for Israel’s sake, and all the hardship that had come on them along the way, and how The Lord had delivered them.

<a name="18:9">18:9</a> Then Jethro rejoiced because of all the good that The Lord had done for Israel, whom he had delivered from the hand of Egypt. <a name="18:10">18:10</a> And Jethro said, “Blessed be The Lord who has delivered you from the hand of Egypt, and from the hand of Pharaoh, who has delivered the people from under the hand of Pharaoh! <a name="18:11">18:11</a> Now I know that The Lord is greater than all the gods, for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them he has destroyed them.” <a name="18:12">18:12</a> Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God; and Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat food with the father-in-law of Moses before God.

<a name="18:13">18:13</a> And on the next day Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood around Moses from morning until evening. <a name="18:14">18:14</a> When his father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why are you sitting by yourself, and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?”

<a name="18:15">18:15</a> And Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God. <a name="18:16">18:16</a> When they have a matter, they come to me and I decide between a man and his neighbor, and I make known the decrees of God and his laws.”

<a name="18:17">18:17</a> Then Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing you are doing is not good. <a name="18:18">18:18</a> You will surely wear out, both you and this people who are with you, for this is too heavy for you; you are not able to do it by yourself. <a name="18:19">18:19</a> Now listen to me, I will give you some advice, and may God be with you: You be for the people a representative to God, and bring their disputes to God. <a name="18:20">18:20</a> And warn them of the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do. <a name="18:21">18:21</a> But choose from the people capable men, God-fearers, men of truth, those who hate bribes, and put them over the people as rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, and rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. <a name="18:22">18:22</a> And they will judge the people all the time, and every great issue they will bring to you, but every small issue they themselves will judge, so that you may make it easier for yourself, and they will bear the burden with you. <a name="18:23">18:23</a> If you do this thing, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people will be able to go to their place satisfied.”

<a name="18:24">18:24</a> So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said. <a name="18:25">18:25</a> And Moses chose capable men from all Israel, and he made them heads over the people, rulers over thousands, rulers over hundreds, rulers over fifties, and rulers over tens. <a name="18:26">18:26</a> And they judged the people at all times; the difficult matters they would bring to Moses, but every small matter they would judge themselves.

<a name="18:27">18:27</a> Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and so he went to his own land.

## Chapter 19

### Israel at Sinai

<a name="19:1">19:1</a> In the third month after the Israelites went out from the land of Egypt, on the very day, they came to the Desert of Sinai. <a name="19:2">19:2</a> After they journeyed from Rephidim, they came to the Desert of Sinai, and they camped in the desert; Israel camped there in front of the mountain.

<a name="19:3">19:3</a> Moses went up to God, and The Lord called to him from the mountain, “Thus you will say to the house of Jacob, and declare to the people of Israel: <a name="19:4">19:4</a> ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I lifted you up on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. <a name="19:5">19:5</a> And now, if you will diligently obey me and keep my covenant, then you will be my special possession out of all the nations, for all the earth is mine. <a name="19:6">19:6</a> And you will be my kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you will speak to the Israelites.”

<a name="19:7">19:7</a> So Moses came and summoned the elders of Israel. He set before them all these words which The Lord had commanded him. <a name="19:8">19:8</a> And all the people answered together and said, “All that The Lord has commanded we will do.” So Moses brought the words of the people back to The Lord.

<a name="19:9">19:9</a> Then The Lord said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and will always believe in you.” And Moses told the words of the people to The Lord.

<a name="19:10">19:10</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and make them wash their clothes <a name="19:11">19:11</a> and be ready by the third day, for on the third day The Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. <a name="19:12">19:12</a> And you will set boundaries for the people all around, saying, “Take heed to yourselves not to go up on the mountain nor touch its edge. Whoever touches the mountain will surely be put to death! <a name="19:13">19:13</a> No hand will touch him  —  but he will surely be stoned or shot through, whether a beast or a human being; he must not live. When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast they may go up on the mountain.”

<a name="19:14">19:14</a> Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes. <a name="19:15">19:15</a> And he said to the people, “Be ready by the third day. Do not go near your wives.”

<a name="19:16">19:16</a> And on the third day in the morning there was thunder and lightning and a dense cloud on the mountain, and the sound of a very loud horn; all the people who were in the camp trembled. <a name="19:17">19:17</a> And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their place at the lower end of the mountain. <a name="19:18">19:18</a> Now Mount Sinai was completely covered with smoke because The Lord had descended on it in fire; and its smoke went up like the smoke of a great furnace, and the whole mountain shook greatly. <a name="19:19">19:19</a> When the sound of the horn grew louder and louder, Moses was speaking and God was answering him with a voice.

<a name="19:20">19:20</a> And The Lord came down on Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain; and The Lord summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. <a name="19:21">19:21</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Go down and solemnly warn the people, lest they force their way through to The Lord to look, and many of them perish. <a name="19:22">19:22</a> And let the priests also, who draw near to The Lord, sanctify themselves, lest The Lord break through against them.”

<a name="19:23">19:23</a> And Moses said to The Lord, “The people are not able to come up to Mount Sinai, because you solemnly warned us, ‘Set boundaries for the mountain and set it apart.’” <a name="19:24">19:24</a> And The Lord said to him, “Go, get down. And you will come up, and Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people force their way through to come up to The Lord, lest he break through against them.” <a name="19:25">19:25</a> So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.

## Chapter 20

### The Decalogue

<a name="20:1">20:1</a> And God spoke all these words:

<a name="20:2">20:2</a> I, The Lord, am your God, who brought you from the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

<a name="20:3">20:3</a> You shall have no other gods before me.

<a name="20:4">20:4</a> You shall not make for yourself a carved image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on earth under it, or that is in the water below. <a name="20:5">20:5</a> You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I, The Lord, your God, am a jealous God, who visits the iniquity of fathers on children, even to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me, <a name="20:6">20:6</a> but who extends faithful love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.

<a name="20:7">20:7</a> You shall not take the name of The Lord your God in vain, for The Lord will not hold guiltless anyone who takes his name in vain.

<a name="20:8">20:8</a> Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it. <a name="20:9">20:9</a> For six days you may labor and do all your work, <a name="20:10">20:10</a> but the seventh day is a Sabbath to The Lord your God; on it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, or your male servant, or your female servant, or your cattle, or your resident foreigner who is in your gates. <a name="20:11">20:11</a> For in six days The Lord made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all that is in them, and he rested on the seventh day; therefore The Lord blessed the Sabbath day and sanctified it.

<a name="20:12">20:12</a> Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land The Lord your God is giving to you.

<a name="20:13">20:13</a> You shall not murder.

<a name="20:14">20:14</a> You shall not commit adultery.

<a name="20:15">20:15</a> You shall not steal.

<a name="20:16">20:16</a> You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.

<a name="20:17">20:17</a> You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.

<a name="20:18">20:18</a> And all the people were seeing the thunderings and the lightning, and heard the sound of the horn, and the mountain smoking  —  and when the people saw it they trembled with fear and kept their distance. <a name="20:19">20:19</a> And they said to Moses, “You speak to us and we will listen, but do not let God speak with us, lest we die.” <a name="20:20">20:20</a> And Moses said to the people, “Do not fear, for God has come to test you, that the fear of him may be before you so that you do not sin.” <a name="20:21">20:21</a> The people kept their distance, but Moses drew near the thick darkness where God was.

### The Altar

<a name="20:22">20:22</a> The Lord said to Moses: “Thus you will say to the Israelites: ‘You yourselves have seen that I have spoken with you from heaven. <a name="20:23">20:23</a> You must not make alongside me gods of silver, nor make gods of gold for yourselves.

<a name="20:24">20:24</a> You must make for me an altar made of earth, and you will sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I cause my name to be honored I will come to you and I will bless you. <a name="20:25">20:25</a> And if you make me an altar of stone, you must not build it of hewn stone, for if you use your tool on it you will have defiled it. <a name="20:26">20:26</a> And you must not go up by steps to my altar, so that your nakedness is not exposed.’

## Chapter 21

### The Decisions

<a name="21:1">21:1</a> These are the decisions that you will set before them:

### Hebrew Servants

<a name="21:2">21:2</a> If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years, but in the seventh year he will go out free without paying anything. <a name="21:3">21:3</a> If he came in by himself he will go out by himself; if he had a wife when he comes in, then his wife will go out with him. <a name="21:4">21:4</a> If his master gave him a wife, and she bore sons or daughters, the wife and the children will belong to her master, and he will go out by himself. <a name="21:5">21:5</a> But if the servant should declare, ‘I love my master, and my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,’ <a name="21:6">21:6</a> then his master will bring him to the judges, and he will bring him to the door, or the doorposts, and his master will bore through his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him forever.

<a name="21:7">21:7</a> If a man sells his daughter as a female servant, she will not go out as the men servants do. <a name="21:8">21:8</a> If she does not please her master, who has desired her for himself, then he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to a foreign nation, because he has dealt deceitfully with her. <a name="21:9">21:9</a> And if he designated her for his son, then he will deal with her after the manner of daughters. <a name="21:10">21:10</a> If he takes another wife, he must not diminish her food, her clothing, and her marital rights. <a name="21:11">21:11</a> And if he does not provide her with these three things, then she will go out free, without paying money.

### Personal Injuries

<a name="21:12">21:12</a> Whoever strikes someone so that he dies must surely be put to death. <a name="21:13">21:13</a> But if he does not do it with premeditation, but it comes about by accident, then I will appoint for you a place where he may flee. <a name="21:14">21:14</a> But if a man willfully attacks his neighbor to kill him with guile, you will take him from my altar to die.

<a name="21:15">21:15</a> And whoever strikes his father and his mother must surely be put to death.

<a name="21:16">21:16</a> And whoever kidnaps someone and sells him, or he is found still holding him, must surely be put to death.

<a name="21:17">21:17</a> And whoever treats his father or his mother disgracefully must surely be put to death.

<a name="21:18">21:18</a> And if men fight, and one strikes his neighbor with a stone, or with his fist, and he does not die, but must remain in bed, <a name="21:19">21:19</a> and then if he rises and walks about outside on his staff, then the one who struck him is innocent, except he must pay for the injured person’s loss of time and see that he is fully healed.

<a name="21:20">21:20</a> And if a man strikes his servant or his female servant with a rod so that he or she dies as a result of the blow, he will surely be punished. <a name="21:21">21:21</a> However, if the injured servant survives one or two days, the owner will not be punished, for he has suffered the loss.

<a name="21:22">21:22</a> And if men fight and hit a pregnant woman and her child is born prematurely, but there is no serious injury, he will surely be punished in accordance with what the woman’s husband will put on him, and he will pay what the court decides. <a name="21:23">21:23</a> But if there is serious injury, then you will give a life for a life, <a name="21:24">21:24</a> eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, <a name="21:25">21:25</a> burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.

<a name="21:26">21:26</a> And if a man strikes the eye of his servant, or the eye of his female servant, so that he destroys it, he will let him go free for the sake of his eye. <a name="21:27">21:27</a> And if he knocks out the tooth of his servant, or the tooth of his female servant, he will let him go free for the sake of the tooth.

### Laws about Animals

<a name="21:28">21:28</a> If a bull gores a man or a woman so that either dies, then the ox must surely be stoned and its flesh must not be eaten; but the owner of the bull will be acquitted. <a name="21:29">21:29</a> But if the bull had the habit of goring, and its owner was warned, and he did not take the necessary precautions, and then it killed a man or a woman, the bull must be stoned and the man must be put to death. <a name="21:30">21:30</a> If a ransom is set for him, then he must pay the redemption for his life according to whatever was set for him. <a name="21:31">21:31</a> If it gores a son or a daughter, according to this judgment will it be done to him. <a name="21:32">21:32</a> If the bull gores a male servant or a female servant, he must pay thirty shekels of silver, and the ox must be stoned.

<a name="21:33">21:33</a> If a man opens a pit, or if he digs a pit, and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it, <a name="21:34">21:34</a> the owner of the pit must repay the loss. He must give money to the owner of them, and the dead animal will be his. <a name="21:35">21:35</a> And if the bull of one man injures the bull of his neighbor so that it dies, then they will sell the live bull and divide its proceeds, and they will also divide the dead bull. <a name="21:36">21:36</a> Or if it is known that the bull had the habit of goring, and its owner did not take the necessary precautions, he must surely pay bull for bull, and the dead animal will be his.

## Chapter 22

### Laws about Property

<a name="22:1">22:1</a> If a man steals an ox or a sheep and kills it or sells it, he must pay back five head of cattle for the ox, and four sheep for the one sheep.

<a name="22:2">22:2</a> If a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there will be no blood guilt for him. <a name="22:3">22:3</a> If the sun has risen on him, then there is blood guilt for him. A thief must surely make full restitution; if he has nothing, then he will be sold for his theft. <a name="22:4">22:4</a> If the stolen item should in fact be found alive in his possession, whether it be an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, he must pay back double.

<a name="22:5">22:5</a> If a man grazes his livestock in a field or a vineyard, and he lets the livestock loose and they graze in the field of another man, he must make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard.

<a name="22:6">22:6</a> If a fire breaks out and spreads to thorn bushes, so that stacked grain or standing grain or the whole field is consumed, the one who started the fire must surely make restitution.

<a name="22:7">22:7</a> If a man gives his neighbor money or articles for safekeeping, and it is stolen from the man’s house, if the thief is caught, he must repay double. <a name="22:8">22:8</a> If the thief is not caught, then the owner of the house will be brought before the judges, to see whether he has laid his hand on his neighbor’s goods. <a name="22:9">22:9</a> In all cases of illegal possessions, whether for an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, or a garment, or any kind of lost item, about which someone says “This belongs to me,” the matter of the two of them will come before the judges, and the one whom the judges declare guilty must repay double to his neighbor. <a name="22:10">22:10</a> If a man gives his neighbor a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast to keep, and it dies, or is hurt, or carried away without anyone seeing it, <a name="22:11">22:11</a> then there will be an oath to The Lord between the two of them, that he has not laid his hand on his neighbor’s goods, and its owner will accept this, and he will not have to make it good. <a name="22:12">22:12</a> But if it was stolen from him, he will make it good to its owner. <a name="22:13">22:13</a> If it is torn in pieces, then he will bring it for evidence, and he will not have to make good what was torn.

<a name="22:14">22:14</a> If a man borrows an animal from his neighbor, and it is hurt or dies when its owner was not with it, he will surely make it good. <a name="22:15">22:15</a> If its owner was with it, he will not have to make it good; if it was hired, what was paid for the hire covers it.

### Moral and Ceremonial Laws

<a name="22:16">22:16</a> If a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged and has sexual relations with her, he must surely endow her to be his wife. <a name="22:17">22:17</a> If her father refuses to give her to him, he must pay money for the bride price of virgins.

<a name="22:18">22:18</a> You must not allow a sorceress to live.

<a name="22:19">22:19</a> Whoever has sexual relations with a beast must surely be put to death.

<a name="22:20">22:20</a> Whoever sacrifices to a god other than The Lord alone must be utterly destroyed.

<a name="22:21">22:21</a> You must not wrong a resident foreigner nor crush him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.

<a name="22:22">22:22</a> You must not afflict any widow or orphan. <a name="22:23">22:23</a> If you afflict them in any way, and they cry to me, I will surely hear their cry. <a name="22:24">22:24</a> And my anger will burn and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives will be widows and your children will be fatherless.

<a name="22:25">22:25</a> If you lend money to any of my people who are needy among you, do not be like a money-lender to him; do not charge him interest. <a name="22:26">22:26</a> If you do take the garment of your neighbor in pledge, you must return it to him by the time the sun goes down, <a name="22:27">22:27</a> for it is his only covering  —  it is his garment for his body. With what else can he lie down? And when he cries out to me, I will hear, for I am gracious.

<a name="22:28">22:28</a> You must not blaspheme God nor curse the ruler of your people.

<a name="22:29">22:29</a> Do not hold back offerings from your granaries or your vats. You must give me the firstborn of your sons. <a name="22:30">22:30</a> You must also do this for your oxen and for your sheep; seven days they may remain with their mothers, but give them to me on the eighth day.

<a name="22:31">22:31</a> And you will be holy people to me; you must not eat any meat torn by animals in the field. You must throw it to the dogs.

## Chapter 23

### Justice

<a name="23:1">23:1</a> You must not give a false report. Do not put your hand with the wicked to be a malicious witness.

<a name="23:2">23:2</a> You must not go after a crowd into evil things; in a lawsuit you must not offer testimony that agrees with a crowd so as to pervert justice, <a name="23:3">23:3</a> and you must not show favor to a poor man in his lawsuit.

<a name="23:4">23:4</a> If you come across your enemy’s ox or donkey wandering off, you must by all means return it to him. <a name="23:5">23:5</a> If you see the donkey of the one who hates you lying under its load, you must not ignore him, but be sure to help him with it.

<a name="23:6">23:6</a> You must not turn away justice for your poor in their lawsuits. <a name="23:7">23:7</a> Keep your distance from a false charge  —  do not kill the innocent and the righteous, for I do not justify the wicked.

<a name="23:8">23:8</a> And you must not receive a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and subverts the words of the righteous.

<a name="23:9">23:9</a> And you must not oppress a resident foreigner, for you know the life of a resident foreigner, for you were resident foreigners in the land of Egypt.

### Sabbaths and Feasts

<a name="23:10">23:10</a> For six years you are to sow your land and gather in its produce. <a name="23:11">23:11</a> But in the seventh year you must let it lie fallow and leave it alone so that the poor of your people may eat, and what they leave the animals may eat; you must do likewise with your vineyard and your olive grove. <a name="23:12">23:12</a> For six days you are to do your work, but on the seventh day you must cease, in order that your ox and your donkey may rest and that your female servant’s son and any hired help may refresh themselves.

<a name="23:13">23:13</a> Pay attention to do everything I have told you, and do not make mention of the names of other gods  —  do not let them be heard on your lips.

<a name="23:14">23:14</a> Three times in the year you must make a pilgrim feast to me. <a name="23:15">23:15</a> You are to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread; seven days you must eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time of the month of Abib, for at that time you came out of Egypt. No one may appear before me empty.

<a name="23:16">23:16</a> You are also to observe the Feast of Harvest, the first-fruits of your labors that you have sown in the field, and the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year when you have gathered in your labors out of the field. <a name="23:17">23:17</a> At three times in the year all your males will appear before the Lord God.

<a name="23:18">23:18</a> You must not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; the fat of my festal sacrifice must not remain until morning. <a name="23:19">23:19</a> The first of the first-fruits of your soil you must bring to the house of The Lord your God.

You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.

### The Angel of the Presence

<a name="23:20">23:20</a> I am going to send an angel before you, to protect you in the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. <a name="23:21">23:21</a> Take heed because of him, and obey his voice; do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in him. <a name="23:22">23:22</a> But if you diligently obey him, and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and I will be an adversary to your adversaries. <a name="23:23">23:23</a> For my angel will go before you, and bring you in to the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and I will cut them off.

<a name="23:24">23:24</a> You must not bow down to their gods; you must not serve them nor do according to their practices. But you must completely overthrow them and smash their standing stones to pieces. <a name="23:25">23:25</a> But you must serve The Lord your God, and he will bless your bread and your water, and I will remove sickness from your midst. <a name="23:26">23:26</a> None will miscarry her young or be barren in your land. I will fulfill the number of your days.

<a name="23:27">23:27</a> I will send my fear before you, and I will destroy all the people to whom you come; I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you. <a name="23:28">23:28</a> I will send hornets before you that will drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite before you. <a name="23:29">23:29</a> I will not drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the wild animals multiply against you. <a name="23:30">23:30</a> Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you become fruitful and inherit the land. <a name="23:31">23:31</a> And I will set your boundaries from the Red Sea as far as to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the river, for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you will drive them out before you.

<a name="23:32">23:32</a> You must make no covenant with them or with their gods. <a name="23:33">23:33</a> They must not live in your land, lest they make you sin against me, for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.

## Chapter 24

### The Lord Ratifies the Covenant

<a name="24:1">24:1</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Come up to The Lord, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship from a distance. <a name="24:2">24:2</a> Moses alone may come near The Lord, but the others must not come near, nor may the people go up with him.

<a name="24:3">24:3</a> And Moses came and told the people all The Lord’s words and all the decisions. All the people answered together, “We are willing to do all the words that The Lord has said.” <a name="24:4">24:4</a> Then Moses wrote all the words of The Lord. Early in the morning he built an altar at the foot of the mountain and arranged twelve standing stones — according to the twelve tribes of Israel. <a name="24:5">24:5</a> And he sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls for peace offerings to The Lord. <a name="24:6">24:6</a> And Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and half of the blood he splashed on the altar. <a name="24:7">24:7</a> And he took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people; and they said, “We are willing to do and obey all that The Lord has spoken.” <a name="24:8">24:8</a> So Moses took the blood and splashed it on the people and said, “This is the blood of the covenant that The Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words.”

<a name="24:9">24:9</a> Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel went up, <a name="24:10">24:10</a> and they saw the God of Israel, and there was under his feet something like a pavement made of sapphire, clear like the heaven itself.

<a name="24:11">24:11</a> But he did not lay a hand on the leaders of the Israelites, so they saw God, and they ate and they drank.

<a name="24:12">24:12</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Come up to me to the mountain and remain there, and I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandments that I have written, so that you may teach them.” <a name="24:13">24:13</a> So Moses set out with Joshua his attendant, and Moses went up the Mount of God. <a name="24:14">24:14</a> He told the elders, “Wait for us in this place until we return to you. Here are Aaron and Hur with you. Whoever has any matters of dispute can approach them.”

<a name="24:15">24:15</a> Moses went up the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. <a name="24:16">24:16</a> The glory of The Lord resided on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day he called to Moses from within the cloud. <a name="24:17">24:17</a> Now the appearance of the glory of The Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in plain view of the people. <a name="24:18">24:18</a> And Moses went into the cloud when he went up the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.

## Chapter 25

### The Materials for the Sanctuary

<a name="25:1">25:1</a> The Lord spoke to Moses: <a name="25:2">25:2</a> “Tell the Israelites to take an offering for me; from every person whose heart makes him willing you are to receive my offering. <a name="25:3">25:3</a> This is the offering you are to receive from them: gold, silver, bronze, <a name="25:4">25:4</a> blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goat’s hair, <a name="25:5">25:5</a> ram skins dyed red, fine leather, acacia wood, <a name="25:6">25:6</a> oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for fragrant incense, <a name="25:7">25:7</a> onyx stones, and other gems to be set in the ephod and in the breastpiece. <a name="25:8">25:8</a> Let them make for me a sanctuary, that I may live among them. <a name="25:9">25:9</a> According to all that I am showing you — the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furnishings  —  you must make it exactly so.

### The Ark of the Covenant

<a name="25:10">25:10</a> Let them make an ark of acacia wood  —  its length is to be three feet nine inches, its width two feet three inches, and its height two feet three inches. <a name="25:11">25:11</a> You are to overlay it with pure gold — inside and outside you must overlay it; and you are to make a surrounding border of gold over it. <a name="25:12">25:12</a> You are to cast four gold rings for it and put them on its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other side. <a name="25:13">25:13</a> You are to make poles of acacia wood, overlay them with gold, <a name="25:14">25:14</a> and put the poles into the rings at the sides of the ark in order to carry the ark with them. <a name="25:15">25:15</a> The poles must remain in the rings of the ark; they must not be removed from it. <a name="25:16">25:16</a> And you are to put into the ark the testimony that I will give to you.

<a name="25:17">25:17</a> And you are to make a propitiatory lid of pure gold; its length is to be three feet nine inches, and its width is to be two feet three inches. <a name="25:18">25:18</a> And you are to make two cherubim of gold, you are to make them of beaten work on the two ends of the propitiatory lid. <a name="25:19">25:19</a> And make one cherub on one end and one cherub on the other end; from the propitiatory lid you are to make the cherubim on the two ends. <a name="25:20">25:20</a> And the cherubim are to be spreading forth their wings upward, overshadowing the propitiatory lid with their wings, and the cherubim are to face each other, looking to the propitiatory lid. <a name="25:21">25:21</a> And you are to put the propitiatory lid on top of the ark; and in the ark you are to put the testimony I am giving you. <a name="25:22">25:22</a> And I will meet with you there, and from above the propitiatory lid, from between the cherubim that are over the ark of the testimony, I will speak with you of all that I will command you for the Israelites.

### The Table of Presence-Bread

<a name="25:23">25:23</a> And you are to make a table of acacia wood; its length is to be three feet, its width is to be one foot six inches, and its height two feet three inches. <a name="25:24">25:24</a> And you are to overlay it with pure gold; and you are to make a border of gold all around it. <a name="25:25">25:25</a> And you are to make for it a frame about three inches broad all around it, and you are to make a border for the frame of it all around. <a name="25:26">25:26</a> And you are to make four rings of gold for it, and you are to attach the rings at the four corners where its four legs are. <a name="25:27">25:27</a> The rings are to be close to the frame as places for the poles to carry the table. <a name="25:28">25:28</a> And you are to make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, so that the table may be carried with them. <a name="25:29">25:29</a> And you are to make plates for it, and ladles for it, and pitchers for it, and bowls for it for the pouring out of offerings; you are to make them of pure gold. <a name="25:30">25:30</a> And you are to set the Bread of Presence on the table before me continually.

The lampstand is to be made of hammered metal; its base and its shaft, its cups, its buds, and its blossoms are to be of one piece with it. <a name="25:32">25:32</a> And six branches are to extend from the sides of the lampstand, three branches of the lampstand from one side and three branches of the lampstand from the other side. <a name="25:33">25:33</a> Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms are to be on one branch, and three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms are to be on the next branch, and the same for the six branches extending out from the lampstand. <a name="25:34">25:34</a> And on the lampstand there are to be four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms <a name="25:35">25:35</a>  —  with a bud under the first two branches from it, and a bud under the next two branches from it, and a bud under the third two branches from it, according to the six branches that extend from the lampstand. <a name="25:36">25:36</a> Their buds and their branches will be one piece, all of it one piece hammered out of pure gold.

<a name="25:37">25:37</a> And you are to make its seven lamps, and then put its seven lamps up on it, so that it will give light to the area in front of it. <a name="25:38">25:38</a> And its trimmers and its trays are to be of pure gold. <a name="25:39">25:39</a> About seventy-five pounds of pure gold is to be used for it and for all these utensils. <a name="25:40">25:40</a> Now be sure to make them according to the pattern you were shown on the mountain.

## Chapter 26

### The Tabernacle

<a name="26:1">26:1</a> And you are to make the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twined linen, and blue and purple and scarlet; you are to make them with cherubim, the work of an artistic designer. <a name="26:2">26:2</a> The length of each curtain is to be forty-two feet and the width of each curtain is to be six feet  —  one measure for every one of the curtains. <a name="26:3">26:3</a> Five curtains are to be joined together, one to another, and the other five curtains are to be joined together, one to another. <a name="26:4">26:4</a> And you are to make loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and in the same way you are to make loops in the outer edge of the other curtain in the second set. <a name="26:5">26:5</a> You are to make fifty loops in the one curtain, and you are to make fifty loops on the end curtain which is on the second set, so that the loops may take hold of one another. <a name="26:6">26:6</a> Then you are to make fifty gold clasps, and join the curtains together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle is a unit.

<a name="26:7">26:7</a> And you are to make curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle; you are to make eleven curtains. <a name="26:8">26:8</a> The length of each curtain is to be forty-five feet, and the width of each curtain is to be six feet  —  one measure for the eleven curtains. <a name="26:9">26:9</a> And you are to join five curtains together by themselves, and the six curtains by themselves.

<a name="26:14">26:14</a> And you are to make a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and over that a covering of hides of fine leather.

The veil will make a division for you between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. <a name="26:34">26:34</a> And you are to put the propitiatory lid on the ark of the testimony in the Holy of Holies. <a name="26:35">26:35</a> And you are to put the table outside the veil, and the lampstand opposite the table on the side of the tabernacle facing south; and you are to place the table on the north side. <a name="26:36">26:36</a> And you are to make a hanging for the entrance of the tent of blue and purple and scarlet yarn and finely twined linen, the work of an embroiderer. <a name="26:37">26:37</a> And you are to make for the hanging five posts of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks will be gold; and you are to cast five bronze bases for them.

For the south side there are to be hangings for the courtyard of fine twined linen, one hundred fifty feet long for one side, <a name="27:10">27:10</a> with its twenty posts and their twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts. <a name="27:11">27:11</a> And likewise for its length on the north side, there are to be hangings for one hundred fifty feet, with its twenty posts and their twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts. <a name="27:12">27:12</a> And the width of the court on the west side is to be seventy-five feet with hangings, with their ten posts and their ten bases. <a name="27:13">27:13</a> And the width of the court on the east side, toward the sunrise, is to be seventy-five feet. <a name="27:14">27:14</a> The hangings of one side are to be twenty-two and a half feet long, with their three posts and their three bases. <a name="27:15">27:15</a> And on the second side there are to be hangings twenty-two and a half feet long, with their three posts and their three bases. <a name="27:16">27:16</a> And for the gate of the courtyard there is to be a curtain of thirty feet, of blue and purple and scarlet yarn and finely twined linen, the work of an embroiderer, with their four posts and their four bases. <a name="27:17">27:17</a> All the posts around the courtyard are to have silver bands; their hooks are to be silver, and their bases bronze. <a name="27:18">27:18</a> The length of the courtyard is to be one hundred fifty feet, and the width seventy-five feet in the west and in the east, and the height of the fine twined linen hangings is to be seven and a half feet, with their bronze bases. <a name="27:19">27:19</a> All the furnishings of the tabernacle used in all its service, even all its tent pins and all the tent pins of the courtyard, are to be of bronze.

This is to be a lasting ordinance among the Israelites for generations to come.

## Chapter 28

### The Clothing of the Priests

<a name="28:1">28:1</a> And you, bring near to you your brother Aaron and his sons with him from among the Israelites, that they may minister as my priests — Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s sons. <a name="28:2">28:2</a> You must make holy garments for your brother Aaron, for glory and for beauty. <a name="28:3">28:3</a> You are to speak to all who are specially skilled, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, so that they may make Aaron’s garments to sanctify him to minister as my priest. <a name="28:4">28:4</a> Now these are the garments that they are to make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a fitted tunic, a turban, and a sash. They are to make holy garments for your brother Aaron and for his sons, that they may minister as my priests. <a name="28:5">28:5</a> The artisans are to receive the gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen.

<a name="28:6">28:6</a> They are to make the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of an artistic designer. <a name="28:7">28:7</a> It is to have two shoulder pieces attached to two of its corners, so it can be joined together. <a name="28:8">28:8</a> And the artistically woven waistband of the ephod that is on it is to be like it, of one piece with the ephod, of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.

<a name="28:9">28:9</a> And you are to take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel, <a name="28:10">28:10</a> six of their names on one stone, and the six remaining names on the second stone, according to the order of their birth. <a name="28:11">28:11</a> You are to engrave the two stones with the names of the sons of Israel with the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a seal; you are to make them to be set in gold filigree settings. <a name="28:12">28:12</a> And you are to put the two stones on the shoulders of the ephod, stones of memorial for the sons of Israel; and Aaron will bear their names before The Lord on his two shoulders for a memorial. <a name="28:13">28:13</a> And you are to make filigree settings of gold, <a name="28:14">28:14</a> and two braided chains of pure gold, like a cord, and attach the chains to the settings.

They are to be enclosed in gold in their filigree settings. <a name="28:21">28:21</a> And the stones are to be for the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, according to the number of their names. Each name according to the twelve tribes is to be like the engravings of a seal.

<a name="28:22">28:22</a> And you are to make for the breastpiece braided chains like cords of pure gold. <a name="28:23">28:23</a> And you are to make for the breastpiece two gold rings, and you are to attach the two rings to the upper two ends of the breastpiece. <a name="28:24">28:24</a> And you are to attach the two gold chains to the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece; <a name="28:25">28:25</a> and the other two ends of the two chains you will attach to the two settings, and you are to attach them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it. <a name="28:26">28:26</a> And you are to make two rings of gold, and put them on the other two ends of the breastpiece, on its edge that is on the inner side of the ephod. <a name="28:27">28:27</a> And you are to make two more gold rings and attach them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the juncture above the waistband of the ephod. <a name="28:28">28:28</a> And they are to tie the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod by blue cord, so that it may be above the waistband of the ephod, and so that the breastpiece will not be loose from the ephod. <a name="28:29">28:29</a> And Aaron will bear the names of the sons of Israel in the breastpiece of decision on his heart, when he goes into the holy place, for a memorial before The Lord continually.

<a name="28:30">28:30</a> And you are to put into the breastpiece of decision the Urim and the Thummim; and they are to be on Aaron’s heart when he goes in before The Lord. And Aaron is to bear the judgment of the Israelites on his heart before The Lord continually.

<a name="28:31">28:31</a> And you are to make the robe of the ephod completely blue. <a name="28:32">28:32</a> And there is to be an opening in its top in the center of it. There is to be an edge all around the opening of it, the work of a weaver, like the opening of a collar, so that it cannot be torn. <a name="28:33">28:33</a> And you are to make pomegranates of blue and of purple and of scarlet all around its hem; and bells of gold between them all around. <a name="28:34">28:34</a> The pattern is to be a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the robe. <a name="28:35">28:35</a> And the robe is to be on Aaron as he ministers, and his sound will be heard when he enters the Holy Place before The Lord and when he leaves, so that he does not die.

<a name="28:36">28:36</a> And you are to make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it after the fashion of the engravings of a seal: “Holiness to The Lord.” <a name="28:37">28:37</a> And you are to attach to it a blue cord so that it may be on the turban; it is to be on the front of the turban. <a name="28:38">28:38</a> And it is to be on Aaron’s forehead; and Aaron will bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the Israelites are to sanctify by all their holy gifts; and it will always be on his forehead, for their acceptance before The Lord. <a name="28:39">28:39</a> You are to weave the tunic of fine linen and make the turban of fine linen, and the sash you are to make the work of an embroiderer.

<a name="28:40">28:40</a> And for Aaron’s sons you are to make tunics; and you are to make sashes for them, and you are to make headbands for them, for glory and for beauty.

<a name="28:41">28:41</a> And you are to clothe them, your brother Aaron and his sons with him. You are to anoint them and ordain them, and sanctify them so that they may minister as my priests. <a name="28:42">28:42</a> And make for them linen undergarments to cover the body; they must cover from the loins to the thighs. <a name="28:43">28:43</a> And they must be on Aaron and his sons when they go in to the tent of meeting, or when they approach the altar to minister in the holy place, so that they bear no iniquity and die. It is to be a perpetual ordinance for him and for his descendants after him.

## Chapter 29

### The Consecration of Aaron

<a name="29:1">29:1</a> Now this is the ritual that you are to do to them to sanctify them so that they may minister as my priests. Take a young bull and two rams without blemish; <a name="29:2">29:2</a> and unleavened bread, and perforated unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil  —  you are to make them using fine wheat flour. <a name="29:3">29:3</a> And you are to put them in one basket, and present them in the basket, along with the bull and the two rams.

<a name="29:4">29:4</a> And you are to bring Aaron and his sons near to the entrance of the tent of meeting; and you are to wash them with water. <a name="29:5">29:5</a> And you are to take the garments and clothe Aaron with the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod, and the breastpiece; you are to fasten the ephod on him by using the skillfully woven waistband. <a name="29:6">29:6</a> And put the turban on his head, and put the holy crown on the turban. <a name="29:7">29:7</a> And you are to take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him. <a name="29:8">29:8</a> And you are to bring his sons near and clothe them with tunics <a name="29:9">29:9</a> and wrap the sashes around Aaron and his sons, and put headbands on them, and so the ministry of priesthood will belong to them by a perpetual ordinance. Thus you are to ordain Aaron and his sons.

<a name="29:10">29:10</a> And you are to bring the bull in front of the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons are to put their hands on the head of the bull; <a name="29:11">29:11</a> and you are to kill the bull before The Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting. <a name="29:12">29:12</a> And you are to take some of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and all the rest of the blood you are to pour out at the base of the altar. <a name="29:13">29:13</a> And you are to take all the fat that covers the entrails, and the lobe that is above the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar. <a name="29:14">29:14</a> But the meat of the bull, its skin, and its dung you are to burn with fire outside the camp. It is the purification offering.

<a name="29:15">29:15</a> And you are to take one ram, and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on its head, <a name="29:16">29:16</a> and you are to kill the ram and take its blood and splash it all around on the altar. <a name="29:17">29:17</a> Then you are to cut the ram into pieces, and wash the entrails and its legs, and put them on its pieces and on its head. <a name="29:18">29:18</a> And you are to burn the whole ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to The Lord, a soothing aroma; it is an offering made by fire to The Lord.

<a name="29:19">29:19</a> And you are to take the second ram; and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on the head of the ram. <a name="29:20">29:20</a> Then you are to kill the ram and take some of its blood and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot, and then splash the blood all around on the altar. <a name="29:21">29:21</a> And you are to take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and on his garments and on his sons and on his sons’ garments with him, so that he may be holy, he and his garments and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.

<a name="29:22">29:22</a> And you are to take from the ram the fat, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and the right thigh  —  for it is the ram for ordination  —  <a name="29:23">29:23</a> and one round flat cake of bread, one perforated cake of oiled bread, and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread that is before The Lord. <a name="29:24">29:24</a> And you are to put all these in Aaron’s hands and in his sons’ hands, and you are to wave them as a wave offering before The Lord. <a name="29:25">29:25</a> Then you are to take them from their hands and burn them on the altar for a burnt offering, for a soothing aroma before The Lord. It is an offering made by fire to The Lord. <a name="29:26">29:26</a> And you are to take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s ordination, and you are to wave it as a wave offering before The Lord; and it is to be your share. <a name="29:27">29:27</a> And you are to sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh of the contribution, which were waved and lifted up as a contribution from the ram of ordination, from what belongs to Aaron and to his sons. <a name="29:28">29:28</a> And it is to be the share for Aaron and for his sons from the Israelites, by a perpetual ordinance, for it is a contribution. It is to be a contribution from the Israelites from their peace offerings, their contribution to The Lord.

<a name="29:29">29:29</a> And the holy garments that belong to Aaron are to belong to his sons after him, so that they may be anointed in them and ordained in them. <a name="29:30">29:30</a> The priest who succeeds him from his sons, when he first comes to the tent of meeting to minister in the Holy Place, is to wear them for seven days.

<a name="29:31">29:31</a> You are to take the ram of the ordination and cook its flesh in a holy place. <a name="29:32">29:32</a> And Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of the ram and the bread that was in the basket at the entrance of the tent of meeting. <a name="29:33">29:33</a> And they are to eat those things by which atonement was made to ordain and to sanctify them, but no one else may eat them, for they are holy. <a name="29:34">29:34</a> And if any of the meat of the ordination offerings or any of the bread is left over until morning, then you are to burn what is left over with fire. It must not be eaten, because it is holy.

<a name="29:35">29:35</a> And thus you are to do to Aaron and his sons, according to all that I have commanded you; you are to ordain them for seven days. <a name="29:36">29:36</a> And every day you are to prepare a bull for a sin offering for atonement. You are to purge the altar by making atonement for it, and you are to anoint it to sanctify it. <a name="29:37">29:37</a> For seven days you are to make atonement for the altar and sanctify it. Then the altar will be most holy. Anything that touches the altar will be holy.

<a name="29:38">29:38</a> Now this is what you are to prepare on the altar every day continually: two lambs a year old. <a name="29:39">29:39</a> The one lamb you are to prepare in the morning, and the second lamb you are to prepare between the evenings. <a name="29:40">29:40</a> And with the first lamb offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil from pressed olives, and a fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering. <a name="29:41">29:41</a> And the second lamb you are to offer between the evenings; you are to prepare it like the meal offering of the morning and like its drink offering, for a soothing aroma, an offering made by fire to The Lord.

<a name="29:42">29:42</a> This will be a regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before The Lord, where I will meet with you to speak to you there. <a name="29:43">29:43</a> And there I will meet with the Israelites, and it will be sanctified by my glory.

<a name="29:44">29:44</a> So I will sanctify the tent of meeting and the altar; and I will sanctify Aaron and his sons, that they may minister as priests to me. <a name="29:45">29:45</a> And I will reside among the Israelites, and I will be their God. <a name="29:46">29:46</a> And they will know that I am The Lord their God, who brought them out from the land of Egypt, so that I may reside among them. I am The Lord their God.

## Chapter 30

### The Altar of Incense

<a name="30:1">30:1</a> And you are to make an altar for burning incense; you are to make it out of acacia wood. <a name="30:2">30:2</a> Its length is to be a foot and a half and its width a foot and a half; it will be square. Its height is to be three feet, with its horns of one piece with it. <a name="30:3">30:3</a> You are to overlay it with pure gold — its top, its four walls, and its horns — and make a surrounding border of gold for it. <a name="30:4">30:4</a> And you are to make two gold rings for it under its border, on its two flanks; you are to make them on its two sides. The rings will be places for poles to carry it with. <a name="30:5">30:5</a> You are to make the poles out of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.

<a name="30:6">30:6</a> And you are to put it in front of the veil that is before the ark of the testimony (before the place of propitiation that is over the testimony), where I will meet you.

<a name="30:7">30:7</a> And Aaron is to burn sweet incense on it morning by morning; when he attends to the lamps he is to burn incense. <a name="30:8">30:8</a> And when Aaron sets up the lamps between the evenings he is to burn incense on it; it is to be a regular incense offering before The Lord throughout your generations. <a name="30:9">30:9</a> You must not offer strange incense on it, nor burnt offering, nor meal offering, and you must not pour out a drink offering on it. <a name="30:10">30:10</a> And Aaron is to make atonement on its horns once in the year from the blood of the sin offering of atonements; once in the year he is to make atonement on it throughout your generations. It is most holy to The Lord.”

### The Ransom Money

<a name="30:11">30:11</a> The Lord spoke to Moses: <a name="30:12">30:12</a> “When you take a census of the Israelites according to their number, then each man is to pay a ransom for his life to The Lord when you number them, so that there will be no plague among them when you number them. <a name="30:13">30:13</a> Everyone who crosses over to those who are numbered is to pay this: a half shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (a shekel weighs twenty gerahs). The half shekel is to be an offering to The Lord. <a name="30:14">30:14</a> Everyone who crosses over to those numbered, from twenty years old and up, is to pay an offering to The Lord. <a name="30:15">30:15</a> The rich are not to increase it, and the poor are not to pay less than the half shekel when giving the offering of The Lord, to make atonement for your lives. <a name="30:16">30:16</a> You are to receive the atonement money from the Israelites and give it for the service of the tent of meeting. It will be a memorial for the Israelites before The Lord, to make atonement for your lives.”

### The Bronze Laver

<a name="30:17">30:17</a> The Lord spoke to Moses: <a name="30:18">30:18</a> “You are also to make a bronze laver with a bronze stand for washing. And you are to put it between the tent of meeting and the altar; and you are to put water in it. <a name="30:19">30:19</a> And Aaron and his sons must wash their hands and their feet from it. <a name="30:20">30:20</a> When they enter the tent of meeting, they must wash with water so that they do not die. Also, when they draw near to minister by burning incense as an offering made by fire to The Lord, <a name="30:21">30:21</a> they must wash their hands and their feet so that they do not die. And this will be a perpetual ordinance for them and for their descendants throughout their generations.”

### Oil and Incense

<a name="30:22">30:22</a> The Lord spoke to Moses: <a name="30:23">30:23</a> “Take choice spices: twelve and a half pounds of free-flowing myrrh, half that  —  about six and a quarter pounds  —  of sweet-smelling cinnamon, six and a quarter pounds of sweet-smelling cane, <a name="30:24">30:24</a> and twelve and a half pounds of cassia, all weighed according to the sanctuary shekel, and four quarts of olive oil. <a name="30:25">30:25</a> You are to make this into a sacred anointing oil, a perfumed compound, the work of a perfumer. It will be sacred anointing oil.

<a name="30:26">30:26</a> With it you are to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony, <a name="30:27">30:27</a> the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense, <a name="30:28">30:28</a> the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its base. <a name="30:29">30:29</a> So you are to sanctify them, and they will be most holy; anything that touches them will be holy.

<a name="30:30">30:30</a> You are to anoint Aaron and his sons and sanctify them, so that they may minister as my priests. <a name="30:31">30:31</a> And you are to tell the Israelites: ‘This is to be my sacred anointing oil throughout your generations. <a name="30:32">30:32</a> It must not be applied to people’s bodies, and you must not make any like it with the same composition. It is holy, and it must be holy to you. <a name="30:33">30:33</a> Whoever makes perfume like it and whoever puts any of it on a stranger will be cut off from his people.’”

<a name="30:34">30:34</a> And The Lord said to Moses: “Take spices, gum resin, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense of equal amounts. <a name="30:35">30:35</a> And you are to make it into an incense, a perfume, the work of the perfumer. It is to be finely ground, and pure and sacred. <a name="30:36">30:36</a> And you are to beat some of it very fine, and put some of it before the ark of the testimony in the tent of meeting where I will meet with you; it is to be most holy to you. <a name="30:37">30:37</a> And the perfume you are to make, you must not make for yourselves using the same composition; it is to be for you holy to The Lord. <a name="30:38">30:38</a> Whoever makes anything like it, to use as perfume, will be cut off from his people.”

## Chapter 31

### Willing Artisans

<a name="31:1">31:1</a> The Lord spoke to Moses: <a name="31:2">31:2</a> “See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, <a name="31:3">31:3</a> and I have filled him with the Spirit of God in skill, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship, <a name="31:4">31:4</a> to make artistic designs for work with gold, with silver, and with bronze, <a name="31:5">31:5</a> and with cutting and setting stone, and with cutting wood, to work in every kind of craftsmanship. <a name="31:6">31:6</a> Moreover, I have also given him Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all the specially skilled I have put wisdom, that they might make everything I have commanded you: <a name="31:7">31:7</a> the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony, the place of propitiation that is on it, all the furnishings of the tent, <a name="31:8">31:8</a> the table with its utensils, the pure lampstand with all its accessories, the altar of incense, <a name="31:9">31:9</a> the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, the laver with its base, <a name="31:10">31:10</a> and also the woven garments, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons, to minister as priests, <a name="31:11">31:11</a> the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place, according to all that I have commanded them.

### Sabbath Observance

<a name="31:12">31:12</a> The Lord said to Moses, <a name="31:13">31:13</a> “Tell the Israelites, ‘Surely you must keep my Sabbaths, for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am The Lord who sanctifies you. <a name="31:14">31:14</a> So you must keep the Sabbath, for it is holy for you. Everyone who defiles it must surely be put to death; indeed, anyone who does any work on it, then that life will be cut off from among his people. <a name="31:15">31:15</a> Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to The Lord; anyone who does work on the seventh day must surely be put to death. <a name="31:16">31:16</a> And the Israelites must keep the Sabbath to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant. <a name="31:17">31:17</a> It is a sign between me and the Israelites forever; for in six days The Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.”

<a name="31:18">31:18</a> And he gave to Moses two tablets of testimony when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, tablets of stone written with the finger of God.

## Chapter 32

### The Sin of the Golden Calf

<a name="32:1">32:1</a> When the people saw that Moses delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered together around Aaron and said to him, “Get up, make us gods that will go before us. As for this fellow Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him!”

<a name="32:2">32:2</a> So Aaron said to them, “Break off the gold earrings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.” <a name="32:3">32:3</a> So all the people broke off the gold earrings that were on their ears, and they brought them to Aaron. <a name="32:4">32:4</a> And he received them from their hand, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made a molten calf. Then they said, “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.”

<a name="32:5">32:5</a> When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it, and Aaron made a proclamation and said, “Tomorrow will be a feast to The Lord.” <a name="32:6">32:6</a> So they got up early on the next day and offered up burnt offerings, and they brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.

<a name="32:7">32:7</a> And The Lord spoke to Moses: “Go, descend, because your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have acted corruptly. <a name="32:8">32:8</a> They have turned aside quickly from the way that I commanded them  —  they have made for themselves a molten calf, and have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, which brought you up from the land of Egypt.’”

<a name="32:9">32:9</a> Then The Lord said to Moses: “I have seen this people, that they are a stiff-necked people. <a name="32:10">32:10</a> So now, leave me alone so that my anger can burn against them and that I may consume them; and I will make from you a great nation.”

<a name="32:11">32:11</a> But Moses sought the favor of The Lord his God. And he said, “O Lord, why does your anger burn against your people, whom you have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? <a name="32:12">32:12</a> Why should the Egyptians say, ‘For evil he led them out to kill them in the mountains, and to destroy them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your burning anger, and relent of this evil against your people. <a name="32:13">32:13</a> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel your servants, to whom you swore by yourself, and spoke to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants like the stars of the heavens, and all this land that I have spoken about I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.’” <a name="32:14">32:14</a> Then The Lord relented over the evil that he had said he was going to do to his people.

<a name="32:15">32:15</a> And Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands. The tablets were written on both sides  —  on the one side and on the other they were written. <a name="32:16">32:16</a> Now the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. <a name="32:17">32:17</a> When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “It is the sound of war in the camp.” <a name="32:18">32:18</a> And Moses said, “It is not the sound of those who shout for victory, nor is it the sound of those who cry because they are overcome, but the sound of singing I hear.”

<a name="32:19">32:19</a> And when he drew near the camp he saw the calf and the dancing, and Moses became extremely angry. He threw the tablets from his hands and broke them to pieces at the bottom of the mountain. <a name="32:20">32:20</a> And then he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and poured it out on the water and made the Israelites drink it.

<a name="32:21">32:21</a> And Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you, that you have brought on them so great a sin?” <a name="32:22">32:22</a> And Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord burn hot; you know the people, that they tend to evil. <a name="32:23">32:23</a> And they said to me, ‘Make us gods that will go before us, for as for this fellow Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.’ <a name="32:24">32:24</a> So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, break it off.’ So they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out.”

<a name="32:25">32:25</a> And Moses saw that the people were running wild, for Aaron had let them get out of control, to the derision from their enemies. <a name="32:26">32:26</a> So Moses stood at the entrance of the camp, and said, “Whoever is for The Lord, come to me.” And all the Levites gathered themselves to him. <a name="32:27">32:27</a> And he said to them, “Thus says The Lord the God of Israel, ‘Each man fasten his sword on his side, and go in and out from entrance to entrance throughout the camp, and each one kill his brother, his friend and neighbor.’”

<a name="32:28">32:28</a> And the Levites did what Moses ordered, and that day about three thousand men of the people died. <a name="32:29">32:29</a> And Moses said, “Your hand was filled today to The Lord, for each of you was against his son or against his brother, so he has given a blessing to you today.

<a name="32:30">32:30</a> And on the next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a very serious sin; but now I will go up to The Lord  —  perhaps I can make atonement on behalf of your sin.”

<a name="32:31">32:31</a> So Moses returned to The Lord, and he said, “Alas, this people has committed a very serious sin, and they have made for themselves gods of gold. <a name="32:32">32:32</a> But now, if you will forgive their sin …, but if not, blot me out from your book that you have written.” <a name="32:33">32:33</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me  —  that person I will blot out of my book. <a name="32:34">32:34</a> So now go, lead the people to the place I have spoken to you about. See, my angel will go before you. But on the day that I visit, then I will visit their sin on them.”

<a name="32:35">32:35</a> And The Lord plagued the people because they had made the calf  —  the one Aaron made.

## Chapter 33

<a name="33:1">33:1</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Go up from here, you and the people whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ <a name="33:2">33:2</a> And I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. <a name="33:3">33:3</a> Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people, and I might destroy you on the way.”

<a name="33:4">33:4</a> When the people heard this troubling word they mourned; no one put on his ornaments. <a name="33:5">33:5</a> For The Lord had said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I went up among you for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments, that I may know what I should do to you.’” <a name="33:6">33:6</a> So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments by Mount Horeb.

### The Presence of the Lord

<a name="33:7">33:7</a> Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp, at a good distance from the camp; and he called it the tent of meeting. And anyone seeking The Lord would go out to the tent of meeting that was outside the camp.

<a name="33:8">33:8</a> And when Moses went out to the tent, all the people would get up and stand at the entrance to their tents, and they would watch Moses until he entered the tent. <a name="33:9">33:9</a> And whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and The Lord would speak with Moses. <a name="33:10">33:10</a> When all the people would see the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people, each one at the entrance of his tent, would rise and worship. <a name="33:11">33:11</a> And The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And then Moses would return to the camp; but his servant, Joshua son of Nun, a young man, did not leave the tent.

<a name="33:12">33:12</a> Then Moses said to The Lord, “See, you have been saying to me, ‘Bring this people up,’ but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. But you said, ‘I know you by name, and also you have found favor in my sight.’ <a name="33:13">33:13</a> And now, if I have found favor in your sight, show me your way, that I may know you, that I may continue to find favor in your sight. And see that this nation is your people.

<a name="33:14">33:14</a> And he said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”

<a name="33:15">33:15</a> And he said to him, “If your presence does not go with us, do not take us up from here. <a name="33:16">33:16</a> For in what way will it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Is it not in your going with us, so that we will be distinguished, I and your people, from all the people who are on the face of the earth?”

<a name="33:17">33:17</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “I will do this thing also that you have spoken, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.”

<a name="33:18">33:18</a> And he said, “Show me your glory.”

<a name="33:19">33:19</a> And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before your face, and I will proclaim The Lord by name before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy.” <a name="33:20">33:20</a> And he said, “You cannot see my face, for no one can see me and live.” <a name="33:21">33:21</a> And The Lord said, “Here is a place by me; you will station yourself on a rock. <a name="33:22">33:22</a> And when my glory passes by, then I will put you in a cleft in the rock and will cover you with my hand while I pass by. <a name="33:23">33:23</a> Then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back, but my face must not be seen.

## Chapter 34

### The New Tablets of the Covenant

<a name="34:1">34:1</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Cut out two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you smashed. <a name="34:2">34:2</a> And be prepared in the morning, and go up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and station yourself for me there on the top of the mountain. <a name="34:3">34:3</a> And no man is to come up with you, nor let any man be seen throughout the mountain, nor let the flocks or the herds graze before that mountain.” <a name="34:4">34:4</a> So Moses cut out two tablets of stone like the first; and early in the morning he went up to Mount Sinai, just as The Lord had commanded him; and he took in his hand two tablets of stone.

<a name="34:5">34:5</a> And The Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there; and he made proclamation of The Lord by name. <a name="34:6">34:6</a> And The Lord passed by before him and proclaimed: “The Lord, The Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, and abounding in loyal love and faithfulness, <a name="34:7">34:7</a> keeping loyal love for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression and sin. But he by no means leaves the guilty unpunished, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and on the children’s children, to the third and fourth generation.”

<a name="34:8">34:8</a> And Moses quickly bowed to the ground, and worshiped. <a name="34:9">34:9</a> And he said, “If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, let my Lord go among us, for we are a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.”

<a name="34:10">34:10</a> And he said, “I am going to make a covenant before all your people. I will do wonders such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation. And all the people among whom you are will see the work of The Lord, for it is a fearful thing that I am doing with you.

<a name="34:11">34:11</a> Keep what I am commanding you this day. I am going to drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. <a name="34:12">34:12</a> Be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it become a snare among you. <a name="34:13">34:13</a> But you must destroy their altars, smash their images, and cut down their Asherah poles. <a name="34:14">34:14</a> For you must not worship any other god, for The Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. <a name="34:15">34:15</a> Be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods, then you will be invited, and you will eat from his sacrifice; <a name="34:16">34:16</a> and you then take their daughters for your sons, and their daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will make your sons prostitute themselves to their gods. <a name="34:17">34:17</a> You must not make yourselves molten gods.

<a name="34:18">34:18</a> You must keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you must eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you; do this at the appointed time of the month Abib, for in the month Abib you came out of Egypt.

<a name="34:19">34:19</a> Every firstborn of the womb belongs to me, even every firstborn of your cattle that is a male, whether ox or sheep. <a name="34:20">34:20</a> Now the firstling of a donkey you may redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, then break its neck. You must redeem all the firstborn of your sons.

No one will appear before me empty-handed.

<a name="34:21">34:21</a> On six days you may labor, but on the seventh day you must rest; in the plowing time and in the harvest you are to rest.

<a name="34:22">34:22</a> And you must observe the Feast of Weeks  —  the firstfruits of the harvest of wheat — and the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year. <a name="34:23">34:23</a> At three times in the year all your men must appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel. <a name="34:24">34:24</a> For I will drive out the nations before you, and enlarge your borders; no man will covet your land when you go up to appear before The Lord your God three times in the year.

<a name="34:25">34:25</a> You must not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; the sacrifice from the feast of Passover must not remain until the following morning.

<a name="34:26">34:26</a> The first of the firstfruits of your soil you must bring to the house of The Lord your God.

You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.”

<a name="34:27">34:27</a> And The Lord said to Moses, “Write these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.” <a name="34:28">34:28</a> So he was there with The Lord forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread, and he did not drink water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten words.

### The Radiant Face of Moses

<a name="34:29">34:29</a> Now when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand  —  when he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. <a name="34:30">34:30</a> When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to approach him. <a name="34:31">34:31</a> But Moses called to them, so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him. Then Moses spoke to them. <a name="34:32">34:32</a> And after this all the Israelites approached; and he commanded them all that The Lord had spoken to him on Mount Sinai. <a name="34:33">34:33</a> When Moses finished speaking with them, he would put a veil on his face. <a name="34:34">34:34</a> But when Moses went in before The Lord to speak with him, he would remove the veil until he came out. Then he would come out and tell the Israelites what he had been commanded. <a name="34:35">34:35</a> When the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone, Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

## Chapter 35

### Sabbath Regulations

<a name="35:1">35:1</a> And Moses assembled all the community of the Israelites and said to them, “These are the words that The Lord has commanded you to do. <a name="35:2">35:2</a> In six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there must be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of complete rest to The Lord. Anyone who does work on it will be put to death. <a name="35:3">35:3</a> You must not kindle a fire in all your homes on the Sabbath day.

### Willing Workers

<a name="35:4">35:4</a> And Moses spoke to all the community of the Israelites, “This is the word that The Lord has commanded: <a name="35:5">35:5</a> ‘Take from you an offering for The Lord. Let everyone who has a willing heart bring an offering to The Lord, gold, silver, bronze, <a name="35:6">35:6</a> blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, fine linen, goat’s hair, <a name="35:7">35:7</a> ram’s skins dyed red, fine leather, acacia wood, <a name="35:8">35:8</a> olive oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, <a name="35:9">35:9</a> onyx stones, and other gems for mounting on the ephod and the breastpiece. <a name="35:10">35:10</a> And every skilled person among you is to come and make all that The Lord has commanded: <a name="35:11">35:11</a> the tabernacle with its tent, its covering, its clasps, its frames, its crossbars, its posts, and its bases; <a name="35:12">35:12</a> the ark, with its poles, the propitiatory lid, and the veil that conceals; <a name="35:13">35:13</a> the table with its poles and all its vessels, and the bread of the Presence; <a name="35:14">35:14</a> the lampstand for the light and its accessories, its lamps, and oil for the light; <a name="35:15">35:15</a> and the altar of incense with its poles, and the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense, and the hanging for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle; <a name="35:16">35:16</a> the altar for the burnt offering with its bronze grating that is on it, its poles, and all its utensils; the laver and its pedestal; <a name="35:17">35:17</a> the hangings of the courtyard, its posts and its bases, and the curtain for the gateway to the courtyard; <a name="35:18">35:18</a> tent pegs for the tabernacle and tent pegs for the courtyard and their ropes; <a name="35:19">35:19</a> the woven garments for serving in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to minister as priests.”

<a name="35:20">35:20</a> So all the community of the Israelites went out from the presence of Moses. <a name="35:21">35:21</a> And they came forward  —  every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whose spirit was willing; they brought the offering for The Lord for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments. <a name="35:22">35:22</a> And they came forward, men and women alike, all who had willing hearts; they brought brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments, all kinds of gold jewelry, and every one who waved a wave offering of gold to The Lord.

<a name="35:23">35:23</a> And every one who had blue or purple or scarlet yarn, or fine linen, or goats’ hair, or rams’ skin dyed red, or fine leather, brought them. <a name="35:24">35:24</a> Everyone making an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to The Lord, and everyone who had acacia wood for any work of the service brought it. <a name="35:25">35:25</a> And every woman who was skilled spun with her hands, and brought what she had spun, blue, or purple, or scarlet yarn, or fine linen. <a name="35:26">35:26</a> And all the women whose heart stirred them up and who were skilled, spun goats’ hair.

<a name="35:27">35:27</a> And the leaders brought onyx stones, and other gems for mounting for the ephod and the breastpiece; <a name="35:28">35:28</a> and spices, and olive oil for the light and for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.

<a name="35:29">35:29</a> The Israelites brought a freewill offering to The Lord, every man and woman whose heart was willing to bring for all the work which The Lord had commanded them to do through Moses.

<a name="35:30">35:30</a> Then Moses said to the Israelites, “See, The Lord has called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. <a name="35:31">35:31</a> He has filled him with the Spirit of God  —  with skill, with understanding, with knowledge, and with all kinds of work, <a name="35:32">35:32</a> to design artistic designs, to work in gold, in silver, and in bronze, <a name="35:33">35:33</a> and in cutting stones for their setting, and in cutting wood, to do work in every artistic craft. <a name="35:34">35:34</a> And he has put it in his heart to teach, he and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. <a name="35:35">35:35</a> He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as craftsmen, designers, embroiderers in blue and purple and scarlet yarn and in fine linen, and weavers. They are craftsmen in all the work and artistic designers.

## Chapter 36

<a name="36:1">36:1</a> “So Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person in whom The Lord has put skill and ability to know how to do all the work of the service of the sanctuary, are to do the work according to all that The Lord has commanded.” <a name="36:2">36:2</a> Then Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person in whom The Lord had put skill  —  everyone whose heart stirred him up to volunteer for the work, to do it. <a name="36:3">36:3</a> And they received from Moses all the offering the Israelites had brought to do the work of the service of the sanctuary, and they still brought him a freewill offering each morning. <a name="36:4">36:4</a> So all the skilled people who were doing all the work of the sanctuary came from their work they were doing, <a name="36:5">36:5</a> and told Moses, “The people are bringing much more than is needed for the service of the work which The Lord commanded us to do.”

<a name="36:6">36:6</a> Moses instructed them to take his message throughout the camp, saying, “Let no man or woman do any more work for the offering for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing any more. <a name="36:7">36:7</a> Now the materials were more than enough for them to do all the work.

### The Building of the Tabernacle

<a name="36:8">36:8</a> And every skilled person among those who were doing the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven in by the work of the designer. <a name="36:9">36:9</a> The length of one curtain was forty-two feet, and its width was six feet; all the curtains were the same size. <a name="36:10">36:10</a> And he joined five of the curtains one to another, and the other five curtains he joined one to another. <a name="36:11">36:11</a> Then he made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set; he did the same along the edge of the end curtain in the second set. <a name="36:12">36:12</a> He made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops at the end curtain that was in the second set, with the loops opposite one another. <a name="36:13">36:13</a> Then he made fifty gold clasps and joined the curtains together one to another with the clasps, so that the tabernacle was one unit.

<a name="36:14">36:14</a> He made curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains. <a name="36:15">36:15</a> The length of one curtain was forty-five feet, and its width was six feet; the eleven curtains were the same size. <a name="36:16">36:16</a> And he joined five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. <a name="36:17">36:17</a> And he made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and fifty loops along the edge of the curtain that couples the second. <a name="36:18">36:18</a> And he made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together so that it might be a unit. <a name="36:19">36:19</a> And he made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of fine leather over that.

<a name="36:20">36:20</a> And he made the frames for the tabernacle out of acacia wood as uprights. <a name="36:21">36:21</a> The length of each frame was fifteen feet, the width of the same frame was two and a quarter feet. <a name="36:22">36:22</a> Each frame had two projections set in order one against the other; he did this for all the frames of the tabernacle. <a name="36:23">36:23</a> So he made frames for the tabernacle, twenty frames for the south side facing south; <a name="36:24">36:24</a> and he made forty silver bases under the twenty frames  —  two bases under one frame for its two projections. <a name="36:25">36:25</a> And for the second side of the tabernacle facing north, he made twenty frames, <a name="36:26">36:26</a> and their forty silver bases, two bases under the one frame, and two bases under each of the other frames. <a name="36:27">36:27</a> And for the side of the tabernacle facing westward, he made six frames; <a name="36:28">36:28</a> and he made two frames for the corners of the tabernacle on the back side. <a name="36:29">36:29</a> At the two corners they were doubled at the lower end and finished together at the top in one ring; so he did for both corners. <a name="36:30">36:30</a> So there were eight frames, and their silver bases were sixteen bases, two bases under each frame. <a name="36:31">36:31</a> And he made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle <a name="36:32">36:32</a> and five bars for the frames on the second side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle on the back side facing west. <a name="36:33">36:33</a> And he made the middle bar to reach from end to end in the midst of the frames. <a name="36:34">36:34</a> And he overlaid the frames with gold, and he made their rings of gold to provide places for the bars; and he overlaid the bars with gold.

<a name="36:35">36:35</a> Then he made the veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twined linen; he embroidered it with cherubim, the work of an artistic designer. <a name="36:36">36:36</a> And he made for it four posts of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, with gold hooks. Then he cast for them four silver bases. <a name="36:37">36:37</a> And he made a hanging for the entrance of the tent, of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer, <a name="36:38">36:38</a> and its five posts with their hooks. And he overlaid their tops and their bands with gold; but their five bases were bronze.

## Chapter 37

### The Making of the Ark

<a name="37:1">37:1</a> And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; its length was three feet nine inches, its width was two feet three inches, and its height was two feet three inches. <a name="37:2">37:2</a> And he overlaid it with pure gold, inside and outside. Then he made for it a gold border all around it. <a name="37:3">37:3</a> And he cast for it four gold rings to be fastened at its four corners, with two rings on its one side, and two rings on its second side. <a name="37:4">37:4</a> And he made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. <a name="37:5">37:5</a> And he put the poles into the rings at the sides of the ark, in order to carry the ark.

<a name="37:6">37:6</a> He also made a propitiatory lid of pure gold; its length was three feet nine inches and its width was two feet three inches. <a name="37:7">37:7</a> And he made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered metal on the two ends of the propitiatory lid, <a name="37:8">37:8</a> one cherub on one end and one cherub on the other end. He made the cherubim from the propitiatory lid on its two ends. <a name="37:9">37:9</a> And the cherubim were spreading their wings upward, overshadowing the propitiatory lid with their wings. And the cherubim faced each other; they were looking toward the propitiatory lid.

### The Making of the Table

<a name="37:10">37:10</a> And he made the table of acacia wood; its length was three feet, its width was one foot six inches, and its height was two feet three inches. <a name="37:11">37:11</a> And he overlaid it with pure gold; and he made for it a gold border all around it. <a name="37:12">37:12</a> He also made a frame for it about three inches wide all around it, and he made a gold border for its frame all around. <a name="37:13">37:13</a> Then he cast four gold rings for it, and he attached the rings at the four corners where its four legs were. <a name="37:14">37:14</a> The rings were close to the frame to provide places for the poles to carry the table. <a name="37:15">37:15</a> And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table. <a name="37:16">37:16</a> And he made the vessels which were on the table out of pure gold, its plates, its ladles, its pitchers and its bowls, to be used in pouring out offerings.

### The Making of the Lampstand

<a name="37:17">37:17</a> And he made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered metal; its base and its shaft, its cups, its buds, and its blossoms were from the same piece. <a name="37:18">37:18</a> And six branches were extending from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from the one side of it, and three branches of the lampstand from the second side of it. <a name="37:19">37:19</a> Three cups shaped like flowers with buds and blossoms were on one branch, and three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms were on the next branch, and the same for all six branches that were extending from the lampstand. <a name="37:20">37:20</a> And on the lampstand there were four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms, <a name="37:21">37:21</a> with a bud under the first two branches from it, and a bud under the next two branches from it, and a bud under the third two branches from it; according to the six branches that extended from it. <a name="37:22">37:22</a> Their buds and their branches were of one piece; all of it was one hammered piece of pure gold. <a name="37:23">37:23</a> And he made seven lamps, as well as its trimmers and trays, of pure gold. <a name="37:24">37:24</a> He made the lampstand and all its accessories with seventy-five pounds of pure gold.

### The Making of the Altar of Incense

<a name="37:25">37:25</a> And he made the incense altar of acacia wood. Its length was a foot and a half and its width a foot and a half  —  a square  —  and its height was three feet. Its horns were of one piece with it. <a name="37:26">37:26</a> And he overlaid it with pure gold  —  its top, its four walls, and its horns — and he made a surrounding border of gold for it. <a name="37:27">37:27</a> He also made two gold rings for it under its border, on its two flanks, on its two sides, as places for poles to carry it with. <a name="37:28">37:28</a> And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.

<a name="37:29">37:29</a> He made the sacred anointing oil and the pure fragrant incense, the work of a perfumer.

## Chapter 38

### The Making of the Altar of Burnt Offering

<a name="38:1">38:1</a> And he made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood. Its length was seven and a half feet, its width was seven and a half feet  —  it was square  —  and its height was four and a half feet. <a name="38:2">38:2</a> He made its horns at its four corners; its horns were part of it. And he overlaid it with bronze. <a name="38:3">38:3</a> Then he made all the utensils of the altar  —  pots, shovels, tossing-bowls, meat hooks, and fire pans  —  he made all its utensils of bronze. <a name="38:4">38:4</a> And he made for the altar a grating, a network of bronze, to be under its ledge, halfway up from the bottom. <a name="38:5">38:5</a> He cast four rings for the four corners of the bronze grating, to provide places for the poles. <a name="38:6">38:6</a> And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. <a name="38:7">38:7</a> Then he put the poles into the rings at the side of the altar, with which to carry it. And he made the altar hollow, out of boards.

<a name="38:8">38:8</a> And he made the laver of bronze and its pedestal of bronze, from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

### The Construction of the Courtyard

<a name="38:9">38:9</a> Then he made the courtyard. On the south side the hangings of the courtyard were of fine twined linen, one hundred fifty feet long, <a name="38:10">38:10</a> with their twenty posts and their twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and their bands on the posts. <a name="38:11">38:11</a> And for the north side the hangings were one hundred fifty feet, with their twenty posts and their twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and their bands on the posts.

And the hooks of the posts and their bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver, and all the posts of the courtyard had silver bands. <a name="38:18">38:18</a> And the curtain for the gate of the courtyard was of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twined linen, the work of an embroiderer. It was thirty feet long, and like the hangings in the courtyard, it was seven and a half feet high, <a name="38:19">38:19</a> with their four posts and their four bronze bases. Their hooks and their bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver. <a name="38:20">38:20</a> And all the tent pins of the tabernacle and of the courtyard all around were bronze.

### The Materials of the Construction

<a name="38:21">38:21</a> This is the inventory of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, which was counted at the instruction of Moses, being the work of the Levites under the direction of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest. <a name="38:22">38:22</a> Now Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything that The Lord had commanded Moses; <a name="38:23">38:23</a> and with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an artisan, and a designer, and an embroiderer in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen.

<a name="38:24">38:24</a> All the gold that was used for the work, in all the work of the sanctuary, namely the gold of the wave offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred thirty shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.

<a name="38:25">38:25</a> And the silver of those who were numbered of the community was one hundred talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel, <a name="38:26">38:26</a> one beka per person, that is, a half shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, for every one who crossed over to those numbered, from twenty years old or older, for a number of 603,550. <a name="38:27">38:27</a> The one hundred talents of silver were used for casting the bases of the sanctuary, and the bases of the veil  —  one hundred bases for one hundred talents, one talent per base. <a name="38:28">38:28</a> From the 1,775 shekels he made hooks for the posts, and overlaid their tops, and made bands for them.

<a name="38:29">38:29</a> And the bronze of the wave offering was seventy talents and 2,400 shekels. <a name="38:30">38:30</a> And with it he made the bases for the door of the tent of meeting, and the bronze altar, and the bronze grating for it, and all the utensils of the altar, <a name="38:31">38:31</a> and the bases for the courtyard all around, and the bases for the gate of the courtyard, and all the tent pins of the tabernacle, and all the tent pins of the courtyard all around.

## Chapter 39

### The Making of the Priestly Garments

<a name="39:1">39:1</a> And from the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for serving in the sanctuary; they made holy garments that were for Aaron, just as The Lord had commanded Moses.

### The Ephod

<a name="39:2">39:2</a> He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and finely twined linen. <a name="39:3">39:3</a> And they hammered the gold into thin sheets, and cut it into narrow strips, to weave them into the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and into the fine linen, the work of an artistic designer. <a name="39:4">39:4</a> They made shoulder pieces for it, attached to two of its corners, so it could be joined together. <a name="39:5">39:5</a> And the artistically woven waistband of the ephod that was on it was like it, of one piece with it, of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twined linen, just as The Lord had commanded Moses.

<a name="39:6">39:6</a> And they set the onyx stones in gold filigree settings, engraved as with the engravings of a seal with the names of the sons of Israel. <a name="39:7">39:7</a> And he put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as stones of memorial for the sons of Israel, just as The Lord had commanded Moses.

### The Breastpiece of Decision

<a name="39:8">39:8</a> Then he made the breastpiece, the work of an artistic designer, in the same fashion as the ephod, of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twined linen. <a name="39:9">39:9</a> It was square  —  they made the breastpiece doubled, nine inches long and nine inches wide when doubled. <a name="39:10">39:10</a> And they set on it four rows of stones: a row of a ruby, a topaz, and a beryl  —  the first row; <a name="39:11">39:11</a> and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and an emerald; <a name="39:12">39:12</a> and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; <a name="39:13">39:13</a> and the fourth row, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in gold filigree settings. <a name="39:14">39:14</a> And the stones were for the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, according to the number of their names, each name according to the twelve tribes was like the engraving of a seal.

<a name="39:15">39:15</a> And they made for the breastpiece braided chains like cords of pure gold. <a name="39:16">39:16</a> And they made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and they attached the two rings to the upper two ends of the breastpiece. <a name="39:17">39:17</a> And they attached the two gold chains to the rings at the ends of the breastpiece, <a name="39:18">39:18</a> and the other two ends of the two chains they attached to the two settings, and they attached them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it. <a name="39:19">39:19</a> And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the other two ends of the breastpiece on its edge, which is on the inner side of the ephod. <a name="39:20">39:20</a> And they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the juncture above the waistband of the ephod. <a name="39:21">39:21</a> And they tied the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod by blue cord, so that it was above the waistband of the ephod, so that the breastpiece would not be loose from the ephod, just as The Lord had commanded Moses.

### The Other Garments

<a name="39:22">39:22</a> And he made the robe of the ephod completely blue, the work of a weaver. <a name="39:23">39:23</a> And there was an opening in the center of the robe, like the opening of a collar, with an edge all around the opening so that it could not be torn. <a name="39:24">39:24</a> And they made around the hem of the robe pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and twined linen. <a name="39:25">39:25</a> And they made bells of pure gold, and attached the bells between the pomegranates around the hem of the robe between the pomegranates. <a name="39:26">39:26</a> There was a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the robe, to be used in ministering, just as The Lord had commanded Moses.

<a name="39:27">39:27</a> And they made tunics of fine linen for Aaron and for his sons, the work of a weaver, <a name="39:28">39:28</a> and the turban of fine linen, the linen headbands, and the undergarments of fine twined linen. <a name="39:29">39:29</a> And the sash was of fine twined linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, the work of an embroiderer, just as The Lord had commanded Moses. <a name="39:30">39:30</a> And they made a plate, the holy diadem, of pure gold, and they wrote on it an inscription, after the fashion of the engravings of a seal, “Holiness to The Lord.” <a name="39:31">39:31</a> Then they attached to it a blue cord, to attach it to the turban above, just as The Lord had commanded Moses.

### Moses Inspects the Sanctuary

<a name="39:32">39:32</a> So all the work of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed. And the Israelites did according to all that The Lord had commanded Moses  —  they did it exactly so. <a name="39:33">39:33</a> And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings, clasps, frames, bars, posts, and bases; <a name="39:34">39:34</a> and the coverings of rams’ skins dyed red, the covering of fine leather, and the protecting veil; <a name="39:35">39:35</a> the ark of the testimony and its poles, and the propitiatory lid; <a name="39:36">39:36</a> the table, all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence; <a name="39:37">39:37</a> the pure lampstand, its lamps, even the lamps set in order, and all its accessories, and oil for the light; <a name="39:38">39:38</a> and the gold altar, and the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense; and the curtain for the entrance to the tent; <a name="39:39">39:39</a> the bronze altar and its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its pedestal; <a name="39:40">39:40</a> the hangings of the courtyard, its posts and its bases, and the curtain for the gateway of the courtyard, its ropes and its tent pins, and all the furnishings of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting; <a name="39:41">39:41</a> the woven garments for serving in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to minister as priests.

<a name="39:42">39:42</a> According to all that The Lord had commanded Moses, so the Israelites did all the work. <a name="39:43">39:43</a> Moses saw all the work  —  and they had done it just as The Lord had commanded  —  they had done it exactly  —  and Moses blessed them.

## Chapter 40

### Setting Up the Sanctuary

<a name="40:1">40:1</a> Then The Lord spoke to Moses: <a name="40:2">40:2</a> “On the first day of the first month you are to set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting. <a name="40:3">40:3</a> And you are to place the ark of the testimony in it, and you are to shield the ark with the veil. <a name="40:4">40:4</a> And you are to bring in the table and set out the things that belong on it; then you are to bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps. <a name="40:5">40:5</a> And you are to put the gold altar for incense in front of the ark of the testimony, and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle. <a name="40:6">40:6</a> And you are to put the altar for the burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting. <a name="40:7">40:7</a> And you are to put the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar; and you are to put water in it. <a name="40:8">40:8</a> And you are to set up the courtyard around it, and you are to put the curtain at the gate of the courtyard. <a name="40:9">40:9</a> And take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and sanctify it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy. <a name="40:10">40:10</a> Then you are to anoint the altar for the burnt offering with all its utensils; you are to sanctify the altar, and it will be the most holy altar. <a name="40:11">40:11</a> You must also anoint the laver and its pedestal, and you are to sanctify it.

<a name="40:12">40:12</a> You are to bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water. <a name="40:13">40:13</a> Then you are to clothe Aaron with the holy garments and anoint him and sanctify him that he may minister as my priest. <a name="40:14">40:14</a> You are to bring his sons and clothe them with tunics <a name="40:15">40:15</a> and anoint them just as you anointed their father, that they may minister as my priests; and their anointing will make them a priesthood that will continue throughout their generations. <a name="40:16">40:16</a> This is what Moses did, according to all The Lord had commanded him  —  so he did.

<a name="40:17">40:17</a> So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month, in the second year. <a name="40:18">40:18</a> When Moses set up the tabernacle and put its bases in place, he set up its frames, attached its bars, and set up its posts. <a name="40:19">40:19</a> Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent over it, as The Lord had commanded Moses. <a name="40:20">40:20</a> And he took the testimony and put it in the ark, attached the poles to the ark, and then put the propitiatory lid on the ark. <a name="40:21">40:21</a> And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, hung the protecting veil, and shielded the ark of the testimony, just as The Lord had commanded Moses.

<a name="40:22">40:22</a> And he put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil. <a name="40:23">40:23</a> And he set the bread in order on it before The Lord, just as The Lord had commanded Moses.

<a name="40:24">40:24</a> And he put the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle. <a name="40:25">40:25</a> Then he set up the lamps before The Lord, just as The Lord had commanded Moses.

<a name="40:26">40:26</a> And he put the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the veil, <a name="40:27">40:27</a> and he burned fragrant incense on it, just as The Lord had commanded Moses.

<a name="40:28">40:28</a> Then he put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle. <a name="40:29">40:29</a> He also put the altar of burnt offering by the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, just as The Lord had commanded Moses.

<a name="40:30">40:30</a> Then he put the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing. <a name="40:31">40:31</a> Moses and Aaron and his sons would wash their hands and their feet from it. <a name="40:32">40:32</a> Whenever they entered the tent of meeting, and whenever they approached the altar, they would wash, just as The Lord had commanded Moses.

<a name="40:33">40:33</a> And he set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar, and put the curtain at the gate of the courtyard. So Moses finished the work.

<a name="40:34">40:34</a> Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of The Lord filled the tabernacle. <a name="40:35">40:35</a> And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it and the glory of The Lord filled the tabernacle. <a name="40:36">40:36</a> But when the cloud was taken up from on the tabernacle, the Israelites would set out on all their journeys; <a name="40:37">40:37</a> but if the cloud was not lifted up, then they would not journey on until the day it was taken up. <a name="40:38">40:38</a> For the cloud of The Lord was on the tabernacle by day, but fire would be on it at night, in plain view of all the house of Israel, in all their journeys.
