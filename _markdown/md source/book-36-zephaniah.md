### The Lord’s Day of Judgment is Approaching

> <a name="1:2">1:2</a> “I will destroy everything from the face of the earth,” says the Lord.
> <a name="1:3">1:3</a> “I will destroy people and animals;
> I will destroy the birds in the sky
> and the fish in the sea.
> (The idolatrous images of these creatures will be destroyed along with evil people.)
> I will remove humanity from the face of the earth,” says the Lord.
> <a name="1:4">1:4</a> “I will attack Judah
> and all who live in Jerusalem.
> I will remove from this place every trace of Baal worship,
> as well as the very memory of the pagan priests.
> <a name="1:5">1:5</a> I will remove those who worship the stars in the sky from their rooftops,
> those who swear allegiance to the Lord while taking oaths in the name of their ‘king,’
> <a name="1:6">1:6</a> and those who turn their backs on the Lord
> and do not want the Lord’s help or guidance.”
> <a name="1:7">1:7</a> Be quiet before the Lord God,
> for the Lord’s day of judgment is almost here.
> The Lord has prepared a sacrificial meal;
> he has ritually purified his guests.
> <a name="1:8">1:8</a> “On the day of the Lord’s sacrificial meal,
> I will punish the princes and the king’s sons,
> and all who wear foreign styles of clothing.
> <a name="1:9">1:9</a> On that day I will punish all who hop over the threshold,
> who fill the house of their master with wealth taken by violence and deceit.
> <a name="1:10">1:10</a> On that day,” says the Lord,
> “a loud cry will go up from the Fish Gate,
> wailing from the city’s newer district,
> and a loud crash from the hills.
> <a name="1:11">1:11</a> Wail, you who live in the market district,
> for all the merchants will disappear
> and those who count money will be removed.
> <a name="1:12">1:12</a> At that time I will search through Jerusalem with lamps.
> I will punish the people who are entrenched in their sin
> those who think to themselves,
> ‘The Lord neither rewards nor punishes.’
> <a name="1:13">1:13</a> Their wealth will be stolen
> and their houses ruined.
> They will not live in the houses they have built,
> nor will they drink the wine from the vineyards they have planted.
> <a name="1:14">1:14</a> The Lord’s great day of judgment is almost here;
> it is very rapidly approaching!
> There will be a bitter sound on the Lord’s day of judgment;
> at that time warriors will cry out in battle.
> <a name="1:15">1:15</a> That day will be a day of God’s anger,
> a day of distress and hardship,
> a day of devastation and ruin,
> a day of darkness and gloom,
> a day of clouds and dark skies,
> <a name="1:16">1:16</a> a day of trumpet blasts and battle cries.
> Judgment will fall on the fortified cities and the high corner towers.
> <a name="1:17">1:17</a> I will bring distress on the people
> and they will stumble like blind men,
> for they have sinned against the Lord.
> Their blood will be poured out like dirt;
> their flesh will be scattered like manure.
> <a name="1:18">1:18</a> Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them
> in the day of the Lord’s angry judgment.
> The whole earth will be consumed by his fiery wrath.
> Indeed, he will bring terrifying destruction on all who live on the earth.”

### The Prophet Warns the People

> <a name="2:1">2:1</a> Bunch yourselves together as if you were straw, you undesirable nation,
> <a name="2:2">2:2</a> before God’s decree becomes reality and the day of opportunity disappears like windblown chaff,
> before the Lord’s raging anger overtakes you—
> before the day of the Lord’s angry judgment overtakes you!
> <a name="2:3">2:3</a> Seek the Lord’s favor, all you humble people of the land who have obeyed his commands!
> Strive to do what is right! Strive to be humble!
> Maybe you will be protected on the day of the Lord’s angry judgment.
> Judgment on Surrounding Nations
> <a name="2:4">2:4</a> Indeed, Gaza will be deserted
> and Ashkelon will become a heap of ruins.
> Invaders will drive away the people of Ashdod by noon,
> and Ekron will be overthrown.
> <a name="2:5">2:5</a> Those who live by the sea, the people who came from Crete, are as good as dead.
> The Lord has decreed your downfall, Canaan, land of the Philistines:
> “I will destroy everyone who lives there.”
> <a name="2:6">2:6</a> The seacoast will be used as pasture lands by the shepherds
> and as pens for their flocks.
> <a name="2:7">2:7</a> Those who are left from the kingdom of Judah will take possession of it.
> By the sea they will graze,
> in the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down in the evening,
> for the Lord their God will intervene for them and restore their prosperity.
> <a name="2:8">2:8</a> “I have heard Moab’s taunts
> and the Ammonites’ insults.
> They taunted my people
> and verbally harassed those living in Judah.
> <a name="2:9">2:9</a> Therefore, as surely as I live,” says the Lord who leads armies, the God of Israel,
> “be certain that Moab will become like Sodom
> and the Ammonites like Gomorrah.
> They will be overrun by weeds,
> filled with salt pits,
> and permanently desolate.
> Those of my people who are left will plunder their belongings;
> those who are left in Judah will take possession of their land.”
> <a name="2:10">2:10</a> This is how they will be repaid for their arrogance,
> for they taunted and verbally harassed the people of the Lord who leads armies.
> <a name="2:11">2:11</a> The Lord will terrify them,
> for he will weaken all the gods of the earth.
> All the distant nations will worship the Lord in their own lands.
> <a name="2:12">2:12</a> “You Ethiopians will also die by my sword.”
> <a name="2:13">2:13</a> The Lord will attack the north
> and destroy Assyria.
> He will make Nineveh a heap of ruins;
> it will be as barren as the desert.
> <a name="2:14">2:14</a> Flocks and herds will lie down in the middle of it,
> as well as every kind of wild animal.
> Owls will sleep in the tops of its support pillars;
> they will hoot through the windows.
> Rubble will cover the thresholds;
> even the cedar work will be exposed to the elements.
> <a name="2:15">2:15</a> This is how the once-proud city will end up—
> the city that was so secure.
> She thought to herself, “I am unique! No one can compare to me!”
> What a heap of ruins she has become, a place where wild animals live!
> Everyone who passes by her taunts her and shakes his fist.

### Jerusalem is Corrupt

> <a name="3:1">3:1</a> The filthy, stained city is as good as dead;
> the city filled with oppressors is finished.
> <a name="3:2">3:2</a> She is disobedient;
> she refuses correction.
> She does not trust the Lord;
> she does not seek the advice of her God.
> <a name="3:3">3:3</a> Her princes are as fierce as roaring lions;
> her rulers are as hungry as wolves in the desert,
> who completely devour their prey by morning.
> <a name="3:4">3:4</a> Her prophets have the audacity to lie;
> they are deceitful men.
> Her priests defile what is holy;
> they break God’s laws.
> <a name="3:5">3:5</a> The just Lord resides within her;
> he commits no unjust acts.
> Every morning he reveals his justice.
> At dawn he appears without fail.
> Yet the unjust know no shame.
> The Lord’s Judgment will Purify
> <a name="3:6">3:6</a> “I destroyed nations;
> their walled cities are in ruins.
> I turned their streets into ruins;
> no one passes through them.
> Their cities are desolate;
> no one lives there.
> <a name="3:7">3:7</a> I thought, ‘Certainly you will respect me!
> Now you will accept correction!’
> If she had done so, her home would not be destroyed
> by all the punishments I have threatened.
> But they eagerly sinned
> in everything they did.
> <a name="3:8">3:8</a> Therefore you must wait patiently for me,” says the Lord,
> “for the day when I attack and take plunder.
> I have decided to gather nations together
> and assemble kingdoms,
> so I can pour out my fury on them—
> all my raging anger.
> For the whole earth will be consumed
> by my fiery anger.
> <a name="3:9">3:9</a> Know for sure that I will then enable
> the nations to give me acceptable praise.
> All of them will invoke the Lord’s name when they pray,
> and will worship him in unison.
> <a name="3:10">3:10</a> From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,
> those who pray to me will bring me tribute.
> <a name="3:11">3:11</a> In that day you will no longer experience shame because of all your rebellious actions,
> for then I will remove from your midst those who proudly boast,
> and you will never again be arrogant on my holy hill.
> <a name="3:12">3:12</a> I will leave in your midst a humble and meek group of people,
> and they will find safety in the Lord’s presence.
> <a name="3:13">3:13</a> The Israelites who remain will not act deceitfully.
> They will not lie,
> and a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouth.
> Indeed, they will graze peacefully like sheep and lie down;
> no one will terrify them.”
> <a name="3:14">3:14</a> Shout for joy, daughter Zion!
> Shout out, Israel!
> Be happy and boast with all your heart, daughter Jerusalem!
> <a name="3:15">3:15</a> The Lord has removed the instruments of judgment that attacked you;
> he has turned back your enemy.
> Israel’s king, the Lord, is in your midst!
> You no longer need to fear disaster.
> <a name="3:16">3:16</a> On that day they will say to Jerusalem,
> “Don’t be afraid, Zion!
> Your hands must not be paralyzed from panic!
> <a name="3:17">3:17</a> The Lord your God is in your midst;
> he is a warrior who can deliver.
> He takes great delight in you;
> he renews you by his love;
> he shouts for joy over you.”
> <a name="3:18">3:18</a> “As for those who grieve because they cannot attend the festivals—
> I took them away from you;
> they became tribute and were a source of shame to you.
> <a name="3:19">3:19</a> Look, at that time I will deal with those who mistreated you.
> I will rescue the lame sheep
> and gather together the scattered sheep.
> I will take away their humiliation
> and make the whole earth admire and respect them.
> <a name="3:20">3:20</a> At that time I will lead you—
> at the time I gather you together.
> Be sure of this! I will make all the nations of the earth respect and admire you
> when you see me restore you,” says the Lord.
