<h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1</h2>

<p><a name="1:1">1:1</a> The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:</p>

<h3 id="introduction:utterfutility">Introduction: Utter Futility</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="1:2">1:2</a> “Futile! Futile!” laments the Teacher,
“Absolutely futile! Everything is futile!”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="futilityillustratedfromnature">Futility Illustrated from Nature</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="1:3">1:3</a> What benefit do people get from all the effort
which they expend on earth?
<a name="1:4">1:4</a> A generation comes and a generation goes,
but the earth remains the same through the ages.
<a name="1:5">1:5</a> The sun rises and the sun sets,
it hurries away to a place from which it rises again.
<a name="1:6">1:6</a> The wind goes to the south and circles around to the north,
round and round the wind goes and on its rounds it returns.
<a name="1:7">1:7</a> All the streams flow into the sea, but the sea is not full,
and to the place where the streams flow, there they will flow again.
<a name="1:8">1:8</a> All this monotony is tiresome; no one can bear to describe it:
The eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear ever content with hearing.
<a name="1:9">1:9</a> What exists now is what will be,
and what has been done is what will be done;
there is nothing truly new on earth.
<a name="1:10">1:10</a> Is there anything about which someone can say, “Look at this! It is new!”?
It was already done long ago, before our time.
<a name="1:11">1:11</a> No one remembers the former events,
nor will anyone remember the events that are yet to happen;
they will not be remembered by the future generations.
Futility of Secular Accomplishment
<a name="1:12">1:12</a> I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
<a name="1:13">1:13</a> I decided to carefully and thoroughly examine
all that has been accomplished on earth.
I concluded: God has given people a burdensome task
that keeps them occupied.
<a name="1:14">1:14</a> I reflected on everything that is accomplished by man on earth,
and I concluded: Everything he has accomplished is futile—like chasing the wind!
<a name="1:15">1:15</a> What is bent cannot be straightened,
and what is missing cannot be supplied.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="futilityofsecularwisdom">Futility of Secular Wisdom</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="1:16">1:16</a> I thought to myself,
“I have become much wiser than any of my predecessors who ruled over Jerusalem;
I have acquired much wisdom and knowledge.”
<a name="1:17">1:17</a> So I decided to discern the benefit of wisdom and knowledge over foolish behavior and ideas;
however, I concluded that even this endeavor is like trying to chase the wind!
<a name="1:18">1:18</a> For with great wisdom comes great frustration;
whoever increases his knowledge merely increases his heartache.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2</h2>

<h3 id="futilityofself-indulgentpleasure">Futility of Self-Indulgent Pleasure</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="2:1">2:1</a> I thought to myself,
“Come now, I will try self-indulgent pleasure to see if it is worthwhile.”
But I found that it also is futile.
<a name="2:2">2:2</a> I said of partying, “It is folly,”
and of self-indulgent pleasure, “It accomplishes nothing!”
<a name="2:3">2:3</a> I thought deeply about the effects of indulging myself with wine—
the whole time my mind was guiding me with wisdom—
and the effects of behaving foolishly,
so that I might discover what is profitable
for people to do on earth during the few days of their lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="futilityofmaterialism">Futility of Materialism</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="2:4">2:4</a> I increased my possessions:
I built houses for myself;
I planted vineyards for myself.
<a name="2:5">2:5</a> I designed royal gardens and parks for myself,
and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
<a name="2:6">2:6</a> I constructed pools of water for myself,
to irrigate my grove of flourishing trees.
<a name="2:7">2:7</a> I purchased male and female slaves,
and I owned slaves who were born in my house;
I also possessed more livestock—both herds and flocks—
than any of my predecessors in Jerusalem.
<a name="2:8">2:8</a> I also amassed silver and gold for myself,
as well as valuable treasures taken from kingdoms and provinces.
I acquired male singers and female singers for myself,
as well as what gives man sensual delight—a harem of beautiful concubines.
<a name="2:9">2:9</a> So I was more wealthy than all my predecessors in Jerusalem,
yet I maintained my objectivity:
<a name="2:10">2:10</a> I did not hold myself back from getting whatever I wanted,
I did not deny myself anything that would bring me pleasure.
So all my accomplishments gave me joy,
this was my reward for all my effort.
<a name="2:11">2:11</a> Yet when I reflected on everything I had accomplished
and on all the effort that I had expended to accomplish it,
I concluded: “All these achievements and possessions are ultimately profitless—
like chasing the wind!
There is nothing gained from them on earth.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="wisdomisbetterthanfolly">Wisdom is Better than Folly</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="2:12">2:12</a> Next, I decided to consider wisdom, as well as foolish behavior and ideas.
For what more can the king’s successor do, except what he has already done?
<a name="2:13">2:13</a> I realized that wisdom is preferable to folly,
just as light is preferable to darkness:
<a name="2:14">2:14</a> The wise man can see where he is going, but the fool walks in darkness.
Yet I also realized that the same fate happens to them both.
<a name="2:15">2:15</a> So I thought to myself, “The fate of the fool will happen even to me!
Then what did I gain by becoming so excessively wise?”
So I lamented to myself,
“The benefits of wisdom are ultimately meaningless!”
<a name="2:16">2:16</a> For the wise man, like the fool, will not be remembered for very long,
because in the days to come, both will already have been forgotten.
Alas, the wise man dies—just like the fool!
<a name="2:17">2:17</a> So I loathed life because what happens on earth seems awful to me;
for all the benefits of wisdom are futile—like chasing the wind.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="futilityofbeingaworkaholic">Futility of Being A Workaholic</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="2:18">2:18</a> So I loathed all the fruit of my effort,
for which I worked so hard on earth,
because I must leave it behind in the hands of my successor.
<a name="2:19">2:19</a> Who knows if he will be a wise man or a fool?
Yet he will be master over all the fruit of my labor
for which I worked so wisely on earth!
This also is futile!
<a name="2:20">2:20</a> So I began to despair about all the fruit of my labor
for which I worked so hard on earth.
<a name="2:21">2:21</a> For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge, and skill;
however, he must hand over the fruit of his labor as an inheritance
to someone else who did not work for it.
This also is futile, and an awful injustice!
Painful Days and Restless Nights
<a name="2:22">2:22</a> What does a man acquire from all his labor
and from the anxiety that accompanies his toil on earth?
<a name="2:23">2:23</a> For all day long his work produces pain and frustration,
and even at night his mind cannot relax!
This also is futile!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="enjoyworkanditsbenefits">Enjoy Work and its Benefits</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="2:24">2:24</a> There is nothing better for people than to eat and drink,
and to find enjoyment in their work.
I also perceived that this ability to find enjoyment comes from God.
<a name="2:25">2:25</a> For no one can eat and drink
or experience joy apart from him.
<a name="2:26">2:26</a> For to the one who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy,
but to the sinner, he gives the task of amassing wealth—
only to give it to the one who pleases God.
This task of the wicked is futile—like chasing the wind!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3</h2>

<h3 id="atimeforalleventsinlife">A Time for All Events in Life</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="3:1">3:1</a> For everything there is an appointed time,
and an appropriate time for every activity on earth:
<a name="3:2">3:2</a> A time to be born, and a time to die;
a time to plant, and a time to uproot what was planted;
<a name="3:3">3:3</a> A time to kill, and a time to heal;
a time to break down, and a time to build up;
<a name="3:4">3:4</a> A time to weep, and a time to laugh;
a time to mourn, and a time to dance.
<a name="3:5">3:5</a> A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones;
a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
<a name="3:6">3:6</a> A time to search, and a time to give something up as lost;
a time to keep, and a time to throw away;
<a name="3:7">3:7</a> A time to rip, and a time to sew;
a time to keep silent, and a time to speak.
<a name="3:8">3:8</a> A time to love, and a time to hate;
a time for war, and a time for peace.
Man is Ignorant of God’s Timing
<a name="3:9">3:9</a> What benefit can a worker gain from his toil?
<a name="3:10">3:10</a> I have observed the burden
that God has given to people to keep them occupied.
<a name="3:11">3:11</a> God has made everything fit beautifully in its appropriate time,
but he has also placed ignorance in the human heart
so that people cannot discover what God has ordained,
from the beginning to the end of their lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="enjoylifeinthepresent">Enjoy Life in the Present</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="3:12">3:12</a> I have concluded that there is nothing better for people
than to be happy and to enjoy themselves as long as they live,
<a name="3:13">3:13</a> and also that everyone should eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all his toil,
for it is a gift from God.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="god’ssovereignty">God’s Sovereignty</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="3:14">3:14</a> I also know that whatever God does will endure forever;
nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken away from it.
God has made it this way, so that men will fear him.
<a name="3:15">3:15</a> Whatever exists now has already been, and whatever will be has already been;
for God will seek to do again what has occurred in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="theproblemofinjusticeandoppression">The Problem of Injustice and Oppression</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="3:16">3:16</a> I saw something else on earth:
In the place of justice, there was wickedness,
and in the place of fairness, there was wickedness.
<a name="3:17">3:17</a> I thought to myself, “God will judge both the righteous and the wicked;
for there is an appropriate time for every activity,
and there is a time of judgment for every deed.
<a name="3:18">3:18</a> I also thought to myself, “It is for the sake of people,
so God can clearly show them that they are like animals.
<a name="3:19">3:19</a> For the fate of humans and the fate of animals are the same:
As one dies, so dies the other; both have the same breath.
There is no advantage for humans over animals,
for both are fleeting.
<a name="3:20">3:20</a> Both go to the same place,
both come from the dust,
and both return to dust.
<a name="3:21">3:21</a> Who really knows if the human spirit ascends upward,
and the animal’s spirit descends into the earth?
<a name="3:22">3:22</a> So I perceived there is nothing better than for people to enjoy their work,
because that is their reward;
for who can show him what the future holds?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4</h2>

<h3 id="eviloppressiononearth">Evil Oppression on Earth</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="4:1">4:1</a> So I again considered all the oppression that continually occurs on earth.
This is what I saw:
The oppressed were in tears, but no one was comforting them;
no one delivers them from the power of their oppressors.
<a name="4:2">4:2</a> So I considered those who are dead and gone
more fortunate than those who are still alive.
<a name="4:3">4:3</a> But better than both is the one who has not been born
and has not seen the evil things that are done on earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="labormotivatedbyenvy">Labor Motivated by Envy</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="4:4">4:4</a> Then I considered all the skillful work that is done:
Surely it is nothing more than competition between one man and another.
This also is profitless—like chasing the wind.
<a name="4:5">4:5</a> The fool folds his hands and does no work,
so he has nothing to eat but his own flesh.
<a name="4:6">4:6</a> Better is one handful with some rest
than two hands full of toil and chasing the wind.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="labormotivatedbygreed">Labor Motivated by Greed</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="4:7">4:7</a> So I again considered another futile thing on earth:
<a name="4:8">4:8</a> A man who is all alone with no companion,
he has no children nor siblings;
yet there is no end to all his toil,
and he is never satisfied with riches.
He laments, “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?”
This also is futile and burdensome task!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="laborisbeneficialwhenitsrewardsareshared">Labor is Beneficial When Its Rewards Are Shared</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="4:9">4:9</a> Two people are better than one,
because they can reap more benefit from their labor.
<a name="4:10">4:10</a> For if they fall, one will lift up his companion,
but pity the person who falls down and has no one to help him up.
<a name="4:11">4:11</a> Furthermore, if two lie together, they can keep each other warm,
but how can one person keep warm by himself?
<a name="4:12">4:12</a> Although an assailant may overpower one person,
two can withstand him.
Moreover, a three-strand cord is not quickly broken.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="labormotivatedbyprestige-seeking">Labor Motivated by Prestige-Seeking</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="4:13">4:13</a> A poor but wise youth is better than an old and foolish king
who no longer knows how to receive advice.
<a name="4:14">4:14</a> For he came out of prison to become king,
even though he had been born poor in what would become his kingdom.
<a name="4:15">4:15</a> I considered all the living who walk on earth,
as well as the second one who would arise in his place.
<a name="4:16">4:16</a> There is no end to all the people nor to the past generations,
yet future generations will not rejoice in him.
This also is profitless and like chasing the wind.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5</h2>

<h3 id="rashvows">Rash Vows</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="5:1">5:1</a> Be careful what you do when you go to the temple of God;
draw near to listen rather than to offer a sacrifice like fools,
for they do not realize that they are doing wrong.
<a name="5:2">5:2</a> Do not be rash with your mouth or hasty in your heart to bring up a matter before God,
for God is in heaven and you are on earth!
Therefore, let your words be few.
<a name="5:3">5:3</a> Just as dreams come when there are many cares,
so the rash vow of a fool occurs when there are many words.
<a name="5:4">5:4</a> When you make a vow to God, do not delay in paying it.
For God takes no pleasure in fools:
Pay what you vow!
<a name="5:5">5:5</a> It is better for you not to vow
than to vow and not pay it.
<a name="5:6">5:6</a> Do not let your mouth cause you to sin,
and do not tell the priest, “It was a mistake!”
Why make God angry at you
so that he would destroy the work of your hands?”
<a name="5:7">5:7</a> Just as there is futility in many dreams,
so also in many words.
Therefore, fear God!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="governmentcorruption">Government Corruption</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="5:8">5:8</a> If you see the extortion of the poor,
or the perversion of justice and fairness in the government,
do not be astonished by the matter.
For the high official is watched by a higher official,
and there are higher ones over them!
<a name="5:9">5:9</a> The produce of the land is seized by all of them,
even the king is served by the fields.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="covetousness">Covetousness</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="5:10">5:10</a> The one who loves money will never be satisfied with money,
he who loves wealth will never be satisfied with his income.
This also is futile.
<a name="5:11">5:11</a> When someone’s prosperity increases, those who consume it also increase;
so what does its owner gain, except that he gets to see it with his eyes?
<a name="5:12">5:12</a> The sleep of the laborer is pleasant—whether he eats little or much—
but the wealth of the rich will not allow him to sleep.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="materialismthwartsenjoymentoflife">Materialism Thwarts Enjoyment of Life</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="5:13">5:13</a> Here is a misfortune on earth that I have seen:
Wealth hoarded by its owner to his own misery.
<a name="5:14">5:14</a> Then that wealth was lost through bad luck;
although he fathered a son, he does not have anything left to give him.
<a name="5:15">5:15</a> Just as he came forth from his mother&#8217;s womb, naked will he return as he came,
and he will take nothing in his hand that he may carry away from his toil.
<a name="5:16">5:16</a> This is another misfortune:
Just as he came, so will he go.
What did he gain from toiling for the wind?
<a name="5:17">5:17</a> Surely, he ate in darkness every day of his life,
and he suffered greatly with sickness and anger.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="enjoythefruitofyourlabor">Enjoy the Fruit of Your Labor</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="5:18">5:18</a> I have seen personally what is the only beneficial and appropriate course of action for people:
to eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all their hard work on earth
during the few days of their life which God has given them,
for this is their reward.
<a name="5:19">5:19</a> To every man to whom God has given wealth, and possessions,
he has also given him the ability
to eat from them, to receive his reward and to find enjoyment in his toil;
this is the gift of God.
<a name="5:20">5:20</a> For he does not think much about the fleeting days of his life
because God keeps him preoccupied with the joy he derives from his activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6</h2>

<h3 id="noteveryoneenjoyslife">Not Everyone Enjoys Life</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="6:1">6:1</a> Here is another misfortune that I have seen on earth,
and it weighs heavily on people:
<a name="6:2">6:2</a> God gives a man riches, property, and wealth
so that he lacks nothing that his heart desires,
yet God does not enable him to enjoy the fruit of his labor—
instead, someone else enjoys it!
This is fruitless and a grave misfortune.
<a name="6:3">6:3</a> Even if a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years—
even if he lives long, long time, but cannot enjoy his prosperity—
even if he were to live forever—
I would say, “A stillborn child is better off than him!”
<a name="6:4">6:4</a> Though the stillborn child came into the world for no reason and departed into darkness,
though its name is shrouded in darkness,
<a name="6:5">6:5</a> though it never saw the light of day nor knew anything,
yet it has more rest than that man—
<a name="6:6">6:6</a> if he should live a thousand years twice, yet does not enjoy his prosperity.
For both of them die!
<a name="6:7">6:7</a> All of man’s labor is for nothing more than to fill his stomach—
yet his appetite is never satisfied!

<p><a name="6:10">6:10</a> Whatever has happened was foreordained,
and what happens to man was also foreknown.
It is useless for him to argue with God about his fate
because God is more powerful than he is.
<a name="6:11">6:11</a> The more man argues with words, the less he accomplishes.
How does that benefit him?
<a name="6:12">6:12</a> For no one knows what is best for a man during his life—
during the few days of his fleeting life—
for they pass away like a shadow.
Nor can anyone tell him what the future will hold for him on earth.</p>

the righteous and the wicked,
