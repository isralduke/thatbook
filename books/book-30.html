He was one of the herdsmen from Tekoa.

The shepherds’ pastures wilt; the summit of Carmel withers.” <a name="1:3">1:3</a> This is what the Lord says: “Because Damascus has committed three crimes— make that four!—I will not revoke my decree of judgment. They ripped through Gilead like threshing boards with iron teeth. <a name="1:4">1:4</a> So I will set Hazael’s house on fire; fire will consume Ben-hadad’s fortresses. <a name="1:5">1:5</a> I will break the bar on the gate of Damascus. I will remove the ruler from Wicked Valley, the one who holds the royal scepter from Beth Eden. The people of Aram will be deported to Kir.” The Lord has spoken! <a name="1:6">1:6</a> This is what the Lord says: “Because Gaza has committed three crimes— make that four!—I will not revoke my decree of judgment. They deported a whole community and sold them to Edom. <a name="1:7">1:7</a> So I will set Gaza’s city wall on fire; fire will consume her fortresses. <a name="1:8">1:8</a> I will remove the ruler from Ashdod, the one who holds the royal scepter from Ashkelon. I will strike Ekron with my hand; the rest of the Philistines will also die.” The sovereign Lord has spoken! <a name="1:9">1:9</a> This is what the Lord says: “Because Tyre has committed three crimes— make that four!—I will not revoke my decree of judgment. They sold a whole community to Edom; they failed to observe a treaty of brotherhood. <a name="1:10">1:10</a> So I will set fire to Tyre’s city wall; fire will consume her fortresses.” <a name="1:11">1:11</a> This is what the Lord says: “Because Edom has committed three crimes— make that four!—I will not revoke my decree of judgment. He chased his brother with a sword; he wiped out his allies. In his anger he tore them apart without stopping to rest; in his fury he relentlessly attacked them. <a name="1:12">1:12</a> So I will set Teman on fire; fire will consume Bozrah’s fortresses.” <a name="1:13">1:13</a> This is what the Lord says: “Because the Ammonites have committed three crimes— make that four!—I will not revoke my decree of judgment. They ripped open Gilead’s pregnant women so they could expand their territory. <a name="1:14">1:14</a> So I will set fire to Rabbah’s city wall; fire will consume her fortresses. War cries will be heard on the day of battle; a strong gale will blow on the day of the windstorm. <a name="1:15">1:15</a> Ammon’s king will be deported; he and his officials will be carried off together.” The Lord has spoken!</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2</h2> <blockquote> <p><a name="2:1">2:1</a> This is what the Lord says: “Because Moab has committed three crimes— make that four!—I will not revoke my decree of judgment.

Does a trap spring up from the ground unless it has surely caught something? <a name="3:6">3:6</a> If an alarm sounds in a city, do people not fear? If disaster overtakes a city, is the Lord not responsible? <a name="3:7">3:7</a> Certainly the sovereign Lord does nothing without first revealing his plan to his servants the prophets. <a name="3:8">3:8</a> A lion has roared!

It will take away your power; your fortresses will be looted.” <a name="3:12">3:12</a> This is what the Lord says: “Just as a shepherd salvages from the lion’s mouth a couple of leg bones or a piece of an ear, so the Israelites who live in Samaria will be salvaged. They will be left with just a corner of a bed, and a part of a couch.” <a name="3:13">3:13</a> Listen and warn the family of Jacob! The sovereign Lord, the God who leads armies, is speaking! <a name="3:14">3:14</a> “Certainly when I punish Israel for their covenant transgressions, I will destroy Bethel’s altars. The horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground. <a name="3:15">3:15</a> I will destroy both the winter and summer houses.

For you love to do this, you Israelites.” The sovereign Lord is speaking! <a name="4:6">4:6</a> “But surely I gave you no food to eat in any of your cities; you lacked food everywhere you live. Yet you did not come back to me.” The Lord is speaking! <a name="4:7">4:7</a> “I withheld rain from you three months before the harvest. I gave rain to one city, but not to another. One field would get rain, but the field that received no rain dried up. <a name="4:8">4:8</a> People from two or three cities staggered into one city to get water, but remained thirsty. Yet you did not come back to me.” The Lord is speaking! <a name="4:9">4:9</a> “I destroyed your crops with blight and disease. Locusts kept devouring your orchards, vineyards, fig trees, and olive trees. Yet you did not come back to me.” The Lord is speaking! <a name="4:10">4:10</a> “I sent against you a plague like one of the Egyptian plagues.

She is abandoned on her own land with no one to help her get up.” <a name="5:3">5:3</a> The sovereign Lord says this: “The city that marches out with a thousand soldiers will have only a hundred left; the town that marches out with a hundred soldiers will have only ten left for the family of Israel.” <a name="5:4">5:4</a> The Lord says this to the family of Israel: “Seek me so you can live! <a name="5:5">5:5</a> Do not seek Bethel! Do not visit Gilgal! Do not journey down to Beersheba! For the people of Gilgal will certainly be carried into exile; and Bethel will become a place where disaster abounds.” <a name="5:6">5:6</a> Seek the Lord so you can live! Otherwise he will break out like fire against Joseph’s family; the fire will consume and no one will be able to quench it and save Bethel. <a name="5:7">5:7</a> The Israelites turn justice into bitterness; they throw what is fair and right to the ground. <a name="5:8">5:8</a> (But there is one who made the constellations Pleiades and Orion; he can turn the darkness into morning and daylight into night. He summons the water of the seas and pours it out on the earth’s surface. The Lord is his name! <a name="5:9">5:9</a> He flashes destruction down upon the strong so that destruction overwhelms the fortified places.) <a name="5:10">5:10</a> The Israelites hate anyone who arbitrates at the city gate; they despise anyone who speaks honestly. <a name="5:11">5:11</a> Therefore, because you make the poor pay taxes on their crops and exact a grain tax from them, you will not live in the houses you built with chiseled stone, nor will you drink the wine from the fine vineyards you planted. <a name="5:12">5:12</a> Certainly I am aware of your many rebellious acts and your numerous sins. You torment the innocent, you take bribes, and you deny justice to the needy at the city gate. <a name="5:13">5:13</a> For this reason whoever is smart keeps quiet in such a time, for it is an evil time. <a name="5:14">5:14</a> Seek good and not evil so you can live! Then the Lord, the God who leads armies, just might be with you, as you claim he is. <a name="5:15">5:15</a> Hate what is wrong, love what is right! Promote justice at the city gate! Maybe the Lord, the God who leads armies, will have mercy on those who are left from Joseph. <a name="5:16">5:16</a> Because of Israel’s sins this is what the Lord, the God who leads armies, the Sovereign One, says: “In all the squares there will be wailing, in all the streets they will mourn the dead. They will tell the field workers to lament and the professional mourners to wail. <a name="5:17">5:17</a> In all the vineyards there will be wailing, for I will pass through your midst,” says the Lord.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="thelorddemandsjustice">The Lord Demands Justice</h3> <blockquote> <p><a name="5:18">5:18</a> Woe to those who wish for the day of the Lord!

It will resemble a sieve being shaken, when not even a pebble falls to the ground. <a name="9:10">9:10</a> All the sinners among my people will die by the sword, the ones who say, ‘Disaster will not come near, it will not confront us.’</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="therestorationofthedavidicdynasty">The Restoration of the Davidic Dynasty</h3> <blockquote> <p><a name="9:11">9:11</a> “In that day I will rebuild the collapsing hut of David. I will seal its gaps, repair its ruins, and restore it to what it was like in days gone by. <a name="9:12">9:12</a> As a result they will conquer those left in Edom and all the nations subject to my rule.” The Lord, who is about to do this, is speaking! <a name="9:13">9:13</a> “Be sure of this, the time is coming,” says the Lord, “when the plowman will catch up to the reaper and the one who stomps the grapes will overtake the planter. Juice will run down the slopes, it will flow down all the hillsides. <a name="9:14">9:14</a> I will bring back my people, Israel; they will rebuild the cities lying in rubble and settle down. They will plant vineyards and drink the wine they produce; they will grow orchards and eat the fruit they produce. <a name="9:15">9:15</a> I will plant them on their land and they will never again be uprooted from the land I have given them,” says the Lord your God.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> </div> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js?ckcachebust=591235831" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js?ckcachebust=591235831" integrity="sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js?ckcachebust=591235831" integrity="sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> </body> </html>
