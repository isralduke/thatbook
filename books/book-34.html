<h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="1:1">1:1</a> The oracle against Nineveh;
the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="godtakesvengeanceagainsthisenemies">God Takes Vengeance against His Enemies</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="1:2">1:2</a> The Lord is a zealous and avenging God;
the Lord is avenging and very angry.
The Lord takes vengeance against his foes;
he sustains his rage against his enemies.
<a name="1:3">1:3</a> The Lord is slow to anger but great in power;
the Lord will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="thedivinewarriordestroyshisenemiesbutprotectshispeople">The Divine Warrior Destroys His Enemies but Protects His People</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>He marches out in the whirlwind and the raging storm;
dark storm clouds billow like dust under his feet.
<a name="1:4">1:4</a> He shouts a battle cry against the seaand makes it dry up;
he makes all the rivers run dry.
Bashan and Carmel wither;
the blossom of Lebanon withers.
<a name="1:5">1:5</a> The mountains tremble before him,
the hills convulse;
the earth is laid waste before him,
the world and all its inhabitants are laid waste.
<a name="1:6">1:6</a> No one can withstand his indignation!
No one can resist his fierce anger!
His wrath is poured out like volcanic fire,
boulders are broken up as he approaches.
<a name="1:7">1:7</a> The Lord is good—
indeed, he is a fortress in time of distress,
and he protects those who seek refuge in him.
<a name="1:8">1:8</a> But with an overwhelming flood
he will make a complete end of Nineveh;
he will drive his enemies into darkness.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="denunciationanddestructionofnineveh">Denunciation and Destruction of Nineveh</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="1:9">1:9</a> Whatever you plot against the Lord, he will completely destroy!
Distress will not arise a second time.
<a name="1:10">1:10</a> Surely they will be totally consumed
like entangled thorn bushes,
like the drink of drunkards,
like very dry stubble.
<a name="1:11">1:11</a> From you, O Nineveh, one has marched forth who plots evil against the Lord,
a wicked military strategist.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="oracleofdeliverancetojudah">Oracle of Deliverance to Judah</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="1:12">1:12</a> This is what the Lord says:
“Even though they are powerful—
and what’s more, even though their army is numerous—
nevertheless, they will be destroyed and trickle away!
Although I afflicted you,
I will afflict you no more.
<a name="1:13">1:13</a> And now, I will break Assyria’s yoke bar from your neck;
I will tear apart the shackles that are on you.”
Oracle of Judgment against the King of Nineveh
<a name="1:14">1:14</a> The Lord has issued a decree against you:
“Your dynasty will come to an end.
I will destroy the idols and images in the temples of your gods.
I will desecrate your grave—because you are accursed!”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="proclamationofthedeliveranceofjudah">Proclamation of the Deliverance of Judah</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="1:15">1:15</a> Look! A herald is running on the mountains!
A messenger is proclaiming deliverance:
“Celebrate your sacred festivals, O Judah!
Fulfill your sacred vows to praise God!
For never again will the wicked Assyrians invade you,
they have been completely destroyed.”
Proclamation of the Destruction of Nineveh</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2</h2>

<h3 id="“proclamationofthedestructionofnineveh”">“Proclamation of the Destruction of Nineveh”</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="2:1">2:1</a> The watchmen of Nineveh shout:
“An enemy who will scatter you is marching out to attack you!”
“Guard the rampart!
Watch the road!
Prepare yourselves for battle!
Muster your mighty strength!”
<a name="2:2">2:2</a> For the Lord will restore the majesty of Jacob,
as well as the majesty of Israel,
though their enemies have plundered them
and have destroyed their fields.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="propheticvisionofthefallofnineveh">Prophetic Vision of the Fall of Nineveh</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="2:3">2:3</a> The shields of his warriors are dyed red;
the mighty soldiers are dressed in scarlet garments.
The metal fittings of the chariots shine like fire on the day of battle;
the soldiers brandish their spears.
<a name="2:4">2:4</a> The chariots race madly through the streets,
they rush back and forth in the broad plazas;
they look like lightning bolts,
they dash here and there like flashes of lightning.
<a name="2:5">2:5</a> The commander orders his officers;
they stumble as they advance;
they rush to the city wall
and they set up the covered siege tower.
<a name="2:6">2:6</a> The sluice gates are opened;
the royal palace is deluged and dissolves.
<a name="2:7">2:7</a> Nineveh is taken into exile and is led away;
her slave girls moan like doves while they beat their breasts.
<a name="2:8">2:8</a> Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days,
but now her people are running away;
she cries out: “Stop! Stop!”—
but no one turns back.
<a name="2:9">2:9</a> Her conquerors cry out:
“Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!”
There is no end to the treasure;
riches of every kind of precious thing.
<a name="2:10">2:10</a> Destruction, devastation, and desolation!
Their hearts faint,
their knees tremble,
each stomach churns, each face turns pale!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tauntagainsttheonce-mightylion">Taunt against the Once-Mighty Lion</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="2:11">2:11</a> Where now is the den of the lions,
the feeding place of the young lions,
where the lion, lioness, and lion cub once prowled
and no one disturbed them?
<a name="2:12">2:12</a> The lion tore apart as much prey as his cubs needed
and strangled prey to provide food for his lionesses;
he filled his lairs with prey
and his dens with torn flesh.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="battlecryofthedivinewarrior">Battle Cry of the Divine Warrior</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="2:13">2:13</a> “I am against you!” declares the Lord who leads armies:
“I will burn your chariots with fire;
the sword will devour your young lions;
you will no longer prey upon the land;
the voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3</h2>

<h3 id="reasonforjudgment:sinsofnineveh">Reason for Judgment: Sins of Nineveh</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="3:1">3:1</a> Woe to the city guilty of bloodshed!
She is full of lies;
she is filled with plunder;
she has hoarded her spoil!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="portrayalofthedestructionofnineveh">Portrayal of the Destruction of Nineveh</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="3:2">3:2</a> The chariot drivers will crack their whips;
the chariot wheels will shake the ground;
the chariot horses will gallop;
the war chariots will bolt forward!
<a name="3:3">3:3</a> The charioteers will charge ahead;
their swords will flash
and their spears will glimmer!
There will be many people slain;
there will be piles of the dead,
and countless casualties—
so many that people will stumble over the corpses.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tauntagainsttheharlotcity">Taunt against the Harlot City</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="3:4">3:4</a> “Because you have acted like a wanton prostitute—
a seductive mistress who practices sorcery,
who enslaves nations by her harlotry,
and entices peoples by her sorcery—
<a name="3:5">3:5</a> I am against you,” declares the Lord who leads armies.
“I will strip off your clothes!
I will show your nakedness to the nations
and your shame to the kingdoms;
<a name="3:6">3:6</a> I will pelt you with filth;
I will treat you with contempt;
I will make you a public spectacle.
<a name="3:7">3:7</a> Everyone who sees you will turn away from you in disgust;
they will say, ‘Nineveh has been devastated!
Who will lament for her?’
There will be no one to comfort you!”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ninevehwillsufferthesamefateasthebes">Nineveh Will Suffer the Same Fate as Thebes</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="3:8">3:8</a> You are no more secure than Thebes—
she was located on the banks of the Nile;
the waters surrounded her,
herrampart was the sea,
the water was her wall.
<a name="3:9">3:9</a> Cush and Egypt had limitless strength;
Put and the Libyans were among her allies.
<a name="3:10">3:10</a> Yet she went into captivity as an exile;
even her infants were smashed to pieces at the head of every street.
They cast lots for her nobility;
all her dignitaries were bound with chains.
<a name="3:11">3:11</a> You too will act like drunkards;
you will go into hiding;
you too will seek refuge from the enemy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="theassyriandefenseswillfail">The Assyrian Defenses Will Fail</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="3:12">3:12</a> All your fortifications will be like fig trees with first-ripe fruit:
If they are shaken, their figs will fall into the mouth of the eater!
<a name="3:13">3:13</a> Your warriors will be like women in your midst;
the gates of your land will be wide open to your enemies;
fire will consume the bars of your gates.
<a name="3:14">3:14</a> Draw yourselves water for a siege!
Strengthen your fortifications!
Trample the mud and tread the clay!
Make mud bricks to strengthen your walls!
<a name="3:15">3:15</a> There the fire will consume you;
the sword will cut you down;
it will devour you like the young locust would.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="theassyriandefenderswillflee">The Assyrian Defenders Will Flee</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Multiply yourself like the young locust;
multiply yourself like the flying locust!
<a name="3:16">3:16</a> Increase your merchants more than the stars of heaven!
They are like the young locust which sheds its skin and flies away.
<a name="3:17">3:17</a> Your courtiers are like locusts,
your officials are like a swarm of locusts!
They encamp in the walls on a cold day,
yet when the sun rises, they fly away;
and no one knows where they are.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="concludingdirge">Concluding Dirge</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><a name="3:18">3:18</a> Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria!
Your officers are slumbering!
Your people are scattered like sheep on the mountains
and there is no one to regather them!
<a name="3:19">3:19</a> Your destruction is like an incurable wound;
your demise is like a fatal injury!
All who hear what has happened to you will clap their hands for joy,
for no one ever escaped your endless cruelty!</p>
