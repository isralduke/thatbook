Give!” There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, “Enough”— <a name="30:16">30:16</a> the grave, the barren womb, land that is not satisfied with water, and fire that never says, “Enough!” <a name="30:17">30:17</a> The eye that mocks at a father and despises obeying a mother— the ravens of the valley will peck it out and the young vultures will eat it. <a name="30:18">30:18</a> There are three things that are too wonderful for me, four that I do not understand: <a name="30:19">30:19</a> the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship in the sea, and the way of a man with a woman. <a name="30:20">30:20</a> This is the way of an adulterous woman: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, “I have not done wrong.” <a name="30:21">30:21</a> Under three things the earth trembles, and under four things it cannot bear up: <a name="30:22">30:22</a> under a servant who becomes king, under a fool who is filled with food, <a name="30:23">30:23</a> under an unloved woman who is married, and under a female servant who dispossesses her mistress. <a name="30:24">30:24</a> There are four things on earth that are small, but they are exceedingly wise: <a name="30:25">30:25</a> ants are creatures with little strength, but they prepare their food in the summer; <a name="30:26">30:26</a> rock badgers are creatures with little power, but they make their homes in the crags; <a name="30:27">30:27</a> locusts have no king, but they all go forth by ranks; <a name="30:28">30:28</a> a lizard you can seize with the hand, but it is in the palaces of the king. <a name="30:29">30:29</a> There are three things that are magnificent in their step, four things that move about magnificently: <a name="30:30">30:30</a> a lion, mightiest of the beasts, who does not retreat from anything; <a name="30:31">30:31</a> a strutting rooster, a male goat, and a king with his army around him. <a name="30:32">30:32</a> If you have done foolishly in exalting yourself or if you have planned evil, put your hand over your mouth! <a name="30:33">30:33</a> For as the churning of milk produces butter and as punching the nose produces blood, so stirring up anger produces strife.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="chapter31">Chapter 31</h2> <h3 id="thewordsoflemuel">The Words of Lemuel</h3> <blockquote> <p><a name="31:1">31:1</a> The words of King Lemuel, an oracle that his mother taught him: <a name="31:2">31:2</a> O my son, O son of my womb, O son of my vows, <a name="31:3">31:3</a> Do not give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which ruins kings. <a name="31:4">31:4</a> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to crave strong drink, <a name="31:5">31:5</a> lest they drink and forget what is decreed, and remove from all the poor their rights. <a name="31:6">31:6</a> Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those who are distressed; <a name="31:7">31:7</a> let them drink and forget their poverty, and remember their misery no more. <a name="31:8">31:8</a> Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak, for the legal rights of all the dying. <a name="31:9">31:9</a> Open your mouth, judge in righteousness, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. The Wife of Noble Character <a name="31:10">31:10</a> Who can find a wife of noble character? For her value is far more than rubies. <a name="31:11">31:11</a> The heart of her husband has confidence in her, and he has no lack of gain. <a name="31:12">31:12</a> She brings him good and not evil all the days of her life. <a name="31:13">31:13</a> She obtains wool and flax, and she is pleased to work with her hands. <a name="31:14">31:14</a> She is like the merchant ships; she brings her food from afar. <a name="31:15">31:15</a> She also gets up while it is still night, and provides food for her household and a portion to her female servants. <a name="31:16">31:16</a> She considers a field and buys it; from her own income she plants a vineyard. <a name="31:17">31:17</a> She begins her work vigorously, and she strengthens her arms. <a name="31:18">31:18</a> She knows that her merchandise is good, and her lamp does not go out in the night. <a name="31:19">31:19</a> Her hands take hold of the distaff, and her hands grasp the spindle. <a name="31:20">31:20</a> She extends her hand to the poor, and reaches out her hand to the needy. <a name="31:21">31:21</a> She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all of her household are clothed with scarlet. <a name="31:22">31:22</a> She makes for herself coverlets; her clothing is fine linen and purple. <a name="31:23">31:23</a> Her husband is well-known in the city gate when he sits with the elders of the land. <a name="31:24">31:24</a> She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes. <a name="31:25">31:25</a> She is clothed with strength and honor, and she can laugh at the time to come. <a name="31:26">31:26</a> She opens her mouth with wisdom, and loving instruction is on her tongue. <a name="31:27">31:27</a> She watches over the ways of her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness. <a name="31:28">31:28</a> Her children rise up and call her blessed, her husband also praises her: <a name="31:29">31:29</a> “Many daughters have done valiantly, but you surpass them all.” <a name="31:30">31:30</a> Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord will be praised. <a name="31:31">31:31</a> Give her credit for what she has accomplished, and let her works praise her in the city gates.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> </div> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js?ckcachebust=591235831" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js?ckcachebust=591235831" integrity="sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js?ckcachebust=591235831" integrity="sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> </body> </html>
